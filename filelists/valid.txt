e_boy1/train/LJ004-0200.wav|0|Another jail, that of Ilchester, was also worthy of all commendation. It exhibited all the good points of that at Bury.

e_boy1/train/LJ019-0045.wav|0|Not less remarkable than this diverse interpretation of a manifest duty

e_boy1/train/LJ024-0045.wav|0|if the appointment of such justices can be called "packing the Courts,"
e_boy1/train/LJ024-0055.wav|0|We think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary

e_boy1/train/LJ025-0072.wav|0|Hence the teleological argument for Cuvier's first diagnostic character
e_boy1/train/LJ025-0082.wav|0|But although Cuvier's leading diagnosis of the animal from the plant will not stand a strict test,
e_boy1/train/LJ025-0092.wav|0|It is now established that nitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter
e_boy1/train/LJ025-0102.wav|0|yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy
e_boy1/train/LJ025-0112.wav|0|With a qualification, to be considered presently, the answer to this question is undoubtedly in the affirmative.

e_boy1/train/LJ025-0162.wav|0|will be vastly greater than the weight of the same substances contained in the bean from which it sprang.
e_boy1/train/LJ025-0172.wav|0|In fact, the bean obtains two of the absolutely indispensable elements of its substance from two distinct sources.
e_boy1/train/LJ026-0006.wav|0|for the manufacture of starchy food from gaseous matter.
e_boy1/train/LJ026-0016.wav|0|They ingest solid proteinaceous food,
e_boy1/train/LJ026-0026.wav|0|As in the liquefaction of gases, there is a "critical point" at which the substance under experiment is neither gaseous nor liquid.
e_boy1/train/LJ026-0036.wav|0|and then a balance must be struck and the doubtful form placed in the kingdom with which it has, on the whole, most points in common.

e_boy1/train/LJ041-0067.wav|0|Other marines also testified that Oswald had few friends and kept very much to himself.

e_boy1/train/LJ041-0117.wav|0|In an attempt to have this discharge reversed,
e_boy1/train/LJ041-0127.wav|0|Oswald must have already learned that the Governor could not help him with his discharge because he was no longer Secretary of the Navy, at the time he made that remark.

e_boy1/train/LJ041-0178.wav|0|not unpopular, end quote, at that time. Donovan testified
e_boy1/train/LJ041-0188.wav|0|The eyes of the future became the eyes of God.

e_boy1/train/LJ042-0015.wav|0|He said living conditions over there convinced him something was wrong with the system, and that possibly Marxism was the answer.
e_boy1/train/LJ042-0025.wav|0|His idea that he was to find, quote, freedom, end quote, in the Soviet Union was to be rudely shattered.

e_boy1/train/LJ042-0046.wav|0|This should answer your question, and also give you a glimpse of my way of thinking. So you speak of advantages. Do you think that is why I am here?

e_boy1/train/LJ042-0156.wav|0|Oswald prefaced his manuscript with a short autobiographical sketch which reads in part as follows, quote,
e_boy1/train/LJ042-0166.wav|0|The latter material expresses great hostility to both communism and capitalism. He wrote, that to a person knowing both of those systems, quote,

e_boy1/train/LJ044-0109.wav|0|It is good to know that movements in support of fair play for Cuba has developed in New Orleans as well as in other cities.
e_boy1/train/LJ044-0119.wav|0|into which Oswald, in his own words, had, quote, thrown himself. He sought advice from the central committee of the Communist Party, U.S.A.,

e_boy1/train/LJ044-0159.wav|0|Thus while Oswald's real intentions, assuming that they were known to himself, are not clear,
e_boy1/train/LJ044-0169.wav|0|In September he began to review Spanish.
e_boy1/train/LJ044-0179.wav|0|He apparently based his claim for a visa in transit to Russia
e_boy1/train/LJ044-0189.wav|0|In spite of his former residence in the Soviet Union and his Fair Play for Cuba Committee activities he had been rebuffed
e_boy1/train/LJ044-0199.wav|0|In retrospect his attempt to go to Cuba or return to the Soviet Union may well have been Oswald's last escape hatch,

e_boy1/train/LJ045-0081.wav|0|Although she denied it in some of her testimony before the Commission,

e_boy1/train/LJ046-0111.wav|0|The Secret Service has attempted to perform this function through the activities of its Protective Research Section
e_boy1/train/LJ046-0121.wav|0|At the time of the assassination PRS was a very small group, comprised of 12 specialists and 3 clerks.
e_boy1/train/LJ046-0131.wav|0|in 1953 this had increased to more than 17,000 items;
e_boy1/train/LJ046-0141.wav|0|Slightly more specific criteria were established for PRS personnel processing White House mail referred by the White House mailroom,
e_boy1/train/LJ046-0151.wav|0|All material received by PRS was separately screened

e_boy1/train/LJ046-0231.wav|0|Its efforts appear to have been too largely directed at the "crank" threat.
e_boy1/train/LJ046-0241.wav|0|PRS required a more direct indication of a threat to the President, and that there was no such indication until the President's scheduled visit to that area became known.
e_boy1/train/LJ046-0251.wav|0|to the other agencies. No specific guidance was provided.
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0007.wav|0|It had interviewed him twice shortly after his return to the United States, again a year later at his request
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0017.wav|0|The file was opened, quote,
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0027.wav|0|In this way, it learned that when Oswald had arrived in the Soviet Union

e_boy1/train/LJ047-0047.wav|0|According to Fain's contemporaneous memorandum and his present recollection,
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0057.wav|0|until March 1963, the FBI continued to accumulate information regarding Oswald but engaged in no active investigation.
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0067.wav|0|Hosty decided that the Lee Harvey Oswald case should be reopened because of the alleged personal difficulties and the contact with the Worker,
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0077.wav|0|Oswald was tentatively located in New Orleans in June,
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0087.wav|0|According to the Bureau, quote,
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0097.wav|0|Agent Quigley did not know of Oswald's prior FBI record when he interviewed him,

e_boy1/train/LJ047-0117.wav|0|William Stuckey, who had appeared on the radio program with Oswald, told the Bureau on August 30
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0127.wav|0|On August 21, 1963, Bureau headquarters instructed the New Orleans and Dallas field offices
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0137.wav|0|On October 3, Hosty reopened the case in Dallas to assist the New Orleans office.
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0147.wav|0|The Department of State did not advise either the CIA or the FBI of these facts.
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0157.wav|0|I asked her if she knew where he worked.
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0167.wav|0|On November 4, Hosty telephoned the Texas School Book Depository and learned that Oswald was working there
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0177.wav|0|As discussed in chapter 6, she failed to report this to Agent Hosty
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0187.wav|0|It was then my plan to interview Marina Oswald in detail concerning both herself and her husband's background. Question:
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0197.wav|0|in view of all the information concerning Oswald in its files, should have alerted the Secret Service to Oswald's presence in Dallas
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0207.wav|0|his association with the Castro groups would have been of concern to us, a knowledge that he had, I believe,
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0217.wav|0|He recalled that the special agent in charge of the Dallas office of the FBI, J. Gordon Shanklin,
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0227.wav|0|He testified that he did not read the newspaper story describing the motorcade route in detail, since he was interested only in the fact
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0237.wav|0|Shortly after Oswald was apprehended and identified, Hosty's superior sent him to observe the interrogation of Oswald.
e_boy1/train/LJ047-0247.wav|0|Hosty has unequivocally denied, first by affidavit and then in his testimony before the Commission,
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0007.wav|0|Director Hoover emphasized that the first indication of Oswald's capacity for violence
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0017.wav|0|We satisfied ourselves that we had met our requirement, namely to find out whether he had been recruited by Soviet intelligence. The case was closed.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0027.wav|0|Nowhere during the course of this investigation or the information that came to us from other agencies was there any indication of a potential for violence on his part.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0037.wav|0|overlooking the motorcade route as a source of danger to the President and did not inform the Secret Service of his employment in the Depository Building.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0047.wav|0|his presence in the School Book Depository job and its location along the route of the motorcade.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0057.wav|0|there might conceivably have been additional investigation of the Oswald case between November 5 and November 22.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0067.wav|0|It is clear from Hosty's testimony that this was construed, at least by him,
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0077.wav|0|FBI-agency community of interests, location of agency head quarters, and the responsiveness of agency representatives.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0087.wav|0|The President's trip to Dallas called into play many standard operating procedures of the Secret Service in addition to its preventive intelligence operations.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0097.wav|0|and had also scheduled visits to other parts of the country immediately before the Texas trip,
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0107.wav|0|Love Field and the Trade Mart.

e_boy1/train/LJ048-0168.wav|0|With the number of men available to the Secret Service and the time available, surveys of hundreds of buildings and thousands of windows is not practical.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0178.wav|0|In accordance with its regular procedures, no survey or other check was made by the Secret Service, or by any other law enforcement agency at its request,
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0188.wav|0|These substitute measures were of limited value. Agent Lawson was unable to state whether he had actually instructed
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0198.wav|0|and although it was not a violation of the law to carry a placard, that they were not to tolerate any actions such as the Stevenson incident
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0208.wav|0|Agent Sorrels, riding in the lead car, did observe the Texas School Book Depository Building as he passed by,
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0218.wav|0|However, the Commission does not believe that agents stationed in a car behind the Presidential car,
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0228.wav|0|and others who were present say that no agent was inebriated or acted improperly.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0238.wav|0|one agent was there from 2 until 5 a.m.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0248.wav|0|President Kennedy was scheduled to speak across the street from his hotel in Fort Worth at 8:30 a.m.

e_boy1/train/LJ048-0268.wav|0|Therefore, the use of intoxicating liquor of any kind, including beer and wine, by members of the White House Detail
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0278.wav|0|The Commission recognizes that the responsibilities of members of the White House detail of the Secret Service are arduous.
e_boy1/train/LJ048-0288.wav|0|might have been more alert in the Dallas motorcade if they had retired promptly in Fort Worth.
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0009.wav|0|When President and Mrs. Kennedy shook hands with members of the public along the fences surrounding the reception area, they were closely guarded by Secret Service agents

e_boy1/train/LJ049-0059.wav|0|Agents are instructed that it is not their responsibility to investigate or evaluate a present danger,
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0069.wav|0|This basic approach to the problem of planning for emergencies is sound.
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0079.wav|0|Many changes have already been made and others are contemplated, some of them in response to the Commission's questions and informal suggestions.

e_boy1/train/LJ049-0119.wav|0|would be conducted by Federal law enforcement officials, in particular, the FBI with the assistance of the Secret Service.
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0129.wav|0|while the CIA has the primary responsibility for collecting intelligence overseas to supplement information acquired by the Department of State.
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0140.wav|0|The Council already includes, in addition to the President and Vice President, the Secretaries of State and Defense and has a competent staff.
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0150.wav|0|A Cabinet-level committee which is actively concerned with these problems would be able to discuss these matters more effectively with the President.
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0160.wav|0|Since that time, the Secret Service has had and exercised responsibility for the physical protection of the President

e_boy1/train/LJ049-0180.wav|0|The Commission has the impression
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0190.wav|0|It has been pointed out that the FBI, as our chief investigative agency,
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0200.wav|0|It is suggested that an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to the President
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0210.wav|0|for examples to a determination of the optimum organization of the President's protection.
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0220.wav|0|that the determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of responsibilities and functions should be left to the Executive and the Congress,
e_boy1/train/LJ049-0230.wav|0|can and should be recommended by this Commission in the interest of the more efficient protection of the President.
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0010.wav|0|Daily supervision of the operations of the Secret Service within the Department of the Treasury should be improved.
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0020.wav|0|in which the Commission believes that the Secret Service has operated with insufficient planning or control.
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0030.wav|0|The Commission also recommends
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0040.wav|0|and reports from other agencies which independently evaluate their information for potential sources of danger.
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0050.wav|0|As a result of these studies, the planning document submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Bureau of the Budget on August 31,

e_boy1/train/LJ050-0070.wav|0|The FBI now transmits information on all defectors, a category which would, of course, have included Oswald.
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0080.wav|0|The suggestions of Federal agencies for revision of these guidelines were solicited.
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0090.wav|0|they seem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation of animus against a Government official.

e_boy1/train/LJ050-0120.wav|0|and for reporting such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate that the group may present a danger to the President.
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0130.wav|0|Finally, these agreements with Federal and local authorities will be of little value
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0140.wav|0|Secretary Dillon testified that the use of such liaison officers is the only effective way to insure that adequate liaison is maintained.
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0150.wav|0|Its present manual filing system is obsolete;
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0160.wav|0|The Commission further recommends that the Secret Service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all of the Federal agencies from which it receives information.
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0170.wav|0|This matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission,
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0180.wav|0|so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the Service's field offices.
e_boy1/train/LJ050-0190.wav|0|However, the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing.

e_girl1/train/LJ033-0167.wav|1|In addition the tape was compared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the bag had been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the Depository.
e_girl1/train/LJ033-0177.wav|1|On December 1, 1963, a replica bag was made from materials found on that date in the shipping room.

e_girl1/train/LJ034-0113.wav|1|The autopsy report indicated an estimated weight of 150 pounds.
e_girl1/train/LJ034-0123.wav|1|Although Brennan testified that the man in the window was standing when he fired the shots, most probably he was either sitting or kneeling.

e_girl1/train/LJ035-0115.wav|1|Oswald's use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other employees in the building.

e_girl1/train/LJ035-0135.wav|1|ran up and said that the President had been shot.
e_girl1/train/LJ035-0145.wav|1|Within a minute after Baker and Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical supervisor for the Texas School Book Depository,
e_girl1/train/LJ035-0155.wav|1|The only exit from the office in the direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front stairway.
e_girl1/train/LJ035-0165.wav|1|At that time the building had not yet been sealed off by the police.
e_girl1/train/LJ035-0175.wav|1|The sergeant did the same thing at the rear of the building.
e_girl1/train/LJ035-0185.wav|1|After inspecting this floor, Sawyer returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the building.
e_girl1/train/LJ035-0195.wav|1|Satisfying himself that Oswald was missing, Truly obtained Oswald's address, phone number, and description from his employment application card.
e_girl1/train/LJ035-0205.wav|1|and no one could be found who saw Oswald anywhere else in the building until after the shooting.
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0005.wav|1|He arrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later.
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0015.wav|1|According to the reconstruction of time and events which the Commission found most credible,
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0025.wav|1|McWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0035.wav|1|The man was on the bus approximately 4 minutes.
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0045.wav|1|Mrs. Bledsoe told him, quote, I am not going to rent to you any more, end quote,
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0055.wav|1|Mrs. Bledsoe identified the shirt as the one Oswald was wearing and she stated she was certain that it was Oswald who boarded the bus.

e_girl1/train/LJ036-0075.wav|1|walked seven blocks directly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately,

e_girl1/train/LJ036-0095.wav|1|but the Commission concluded that this man was not Lee Harvey Oswald,
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0105.wav|1|He said, quote,
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0115.wav|1|David Knapp, aged 18, was No. 2;
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0125.wav|1|and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while at other times he waited to record three or four trips.

e_girl1/train/LJ036-0185.wav|1|He hurried to his room and stayed no longer than 3 or 4 minutes.
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0195.wav|1|He was described by Chief Curry as having the reputation of being "a very fine, dedicated officer."
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0205.wav|1|Tippit must have heard the description of the suspect wanted for the President's shooting; it was broadcast over channel 1 at 12:45 p.m.,
e_girl1/train/LJ036-0215.wav|1|He approached the car and apparently exchanged words with Tippit through the right front or vent window.
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0007.wav|1|Three others subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph.
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0017.wav|1|The man cut across the yard through some bushes, passed within 12 feet of Scoggins, and ran south on Patton.

e_girl1/train/LJ037-0087.wav|1|I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When they made him turn sideways, I was positive that was the one I seen, end quote.
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0097.wav|1|Smith subsequently told a Commission staff member
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0107.wav|1|They saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver held high in his right hand. According to Callaway, the man crossed to the west side of Patton.
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0117.wav|1|Both men picked Oswald as the man who had run south on Patton with a gun in his hand.
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0127.wav|1|Four men -- Warren Reynolds, Harold Russell, Pat Patterson, and L. J. Lewis
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0137.wav|1|He was then shown two photographs of Oswald and he advised that Oswald was, quote, unquestionably, end quote, the man he saw.

e_girl1/train/LJ037-0207.wav|1|Michaelis furnished the shipping copy of the invoice, and the Railway Express Agency shipping documents, showing that
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0217.wav|1|Police found an empty revolver holster when they searched Oswald's room on Beckley Avenue after his arrest.

e_girl1/train/LJ037-0237.wav|1|When interviewed by FBI agents on January 21, 1964,
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0247.wav|1|Marina Oswald also identified Commission Exhibit No. 162, the jacket found by Captain Westbrook, as her husband's second jacket.
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0257.wav|1|Scoggins thought it was lighter.
e_girl1/train/LJ037-0267.wav|1|to the exclusion of all other weapons,
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0008.wav|1|Brewer knew from radio broadcasts that the President had been shot and that a patrolman had also been shot in Oak Cliff.
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0018.wav|1|Shortly thereafter, Johnny Brewer, who had come from the nearby shoestore, asked Mrs. Postal whether the fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket.
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0028.wav|1|Brewer met McDonald and the other policemen at the alley exit door,
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0038.wav|1|McDonald struck back with his right hand and grabbed the gun with his left hand. They both fell into the seats.

e_girl1/train/LJ038-0068.wav|1|cursing a little bit and hollering police brutality, end quote.
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0078.wav|1|Oswald was questioned intermittently for approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m., on November 22, and 11 a.m.,

e_girl1/train/LJ038-0128.wav|1|He also denied that he had received the rifle through this box.
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0138.wav|1|When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald lied again.
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0148.wav|1|Actions During and After Shooting
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0158.wav|1|Jarman testified that he ate his lunch on the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and that he neither ate lunch with nor saw Oswald.
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0168.wav|1|There were no eyewitnesses, although a 14-year-old boy in a neighboring house claimed that immediately after the shooting

e_girl1/train/LJ038-0210.wav|1|according to Marina Oswald when he learned on the radio and in the newspapers the next day that he had missed,
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0220.wav|1|Oswald had paid the first month's rent in advance on March 2, 1963,

e_girl1/train/LJ038-0260.wav|1|On November 30, 1963, the FBI requested the bullet for ballistics examination;
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0270.wav|1|which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.

e_girl1/train/LJ038-0290.wav|1|provide important corroboration for her account of the incident.
e_girl1/train/LJ038-0300.wav|1|Based on (1) the contents of the note which Oswald left for his wife on April 10, 1963,
e_girl1/train/LJ039-0004.wav|1|Chapter 4. The Assassin: Part 8.
e_girl1/train/LJ039-0014.wav|1|Marina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11, 1964,
e_girl1/train/LJ039-0024.wav|1|She stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving the house. Quote, I couldn't keep him from going out if he really wanted to, end quote.
e_girl1/train/LJ039-0034.wav|1|The Commission has concluded, therefore, that regardless of what Oswald may have said to his wife
e_girl1/train/LJ039-0044.wav|1|Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit took place on April 23rd.

e_girl1/train/LJ039-0174.wav|1|The marksmen took as much time as they wanted for the first target and all hit the target.
e_girl1/train/LJ039-0184.wav|1|Considering the various probabilities which may have prevailed during the actual assassination,
e_girl1/train/LJ039-0194.wav|1|All three of the firers in these tests

e_girl1/train/LJ040-0006.wav|1|The Commission has considered many possible motives for the assassination, including those which might flow from Oswald's commitment to Marxism or communism,
e_girl1/train/LJ040-0016.wav|1|and in the history of his life which does give some insight into his character and, possibly, into the motives for his act.
e_girl1/train/LJ040-0026.wav|1|He had very few, if any, close relationships with other people and he appeared to have great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world.
e_girl1/train/LJ040-0036.wav|1|and, apparently seriously, as a political prophet -- a man who said that after 20 years he would be prime minister.

e_girl1/train/LJ040-0106.wav|1|It also appears that Lee tried to tag along with his older brothers
e_girl1/train/LJ040-0116.wav|1|who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother, having struck her on at least one occasion.
e_girl1/train/LJ040-0126.wav|1|Oswald was remanded for psychiatric observation to Youth House, an institution in which children are kept for psychiatric observation

e_girl1/train/LJ040-0216.wav|1|In view of his experiences when he visited his relatives in New Orleans in the spring of 1950, and his other solitary habits,

e_girl1/train/LJ041-0006.wav|1|His mother exercised little control over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go on in school.
e_girl1/train/LJ041-0016.wav|1|Voebel took Oswald back to the school to attend to his wounds, and their, quote, mild friendship, end quote, stemmed from that incident.
e_girl1/train/LJ041-0026.wav|1|from which Oswald appeared to suffer.
e_girl1/train/LJ041-0036.wav|1|He was a little dismayed at this, and he said that he couldn't find any that would show any interest in him as a Communist,
e_girl1/train/LJ041-0046.wav|1|There is evidence that Oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join the Marines by the fact that his brother Robert had done so

e_girl1/train/LJ041-0176.wav|1|He recalled that Oswald had a specific interest in Latin America, particularly Cuba,
e_girl1/train/LJ041-0186.wav|1|as some kind of tribunal,
e_girl1/train/LJ041-0196.wav|1|even though as his wife suggested, that interest may have been motivated by a desire to gain attention. He used his Marxist and associated activities

e_girl1/train/LJ042-0134.wav|1|The psychological effects of that change must have been highly unsettling. It should be remembered

e_girl1/train/LJ048-0105.wav|1|but these routes would not have been in accordance with the White House staff instructions given the Secret Service for a desirable motorcade route.
e_girl1/train/LJ048-0116.wav|1|Agent Lawson was not given written instructions concerning the Dallas trip or advice about any peculiar problems which it might involve;
e_girl1/train/LJ048-0126.wav|1|Special Agent in Charge Sorrels testified that the advance preparations followed on this occasion were, quote, pretty much the same, end quote,
e_girl1/train/LJ048-0136.wav|1|In the description of the important aspects of the advance preparations,
e_girl1/train/LJ048-0146.wav|1|Discussions with the Dallas authorities and requests made of them were entirely informal.
e_girl1/train/LJ048-0156.wav|1|and suggested the desirability of such a statement.
e_girl1/train/LJ048-0166.wav|1|But on out-of-town trips where the route is decided on and made public only a few days in advance,
e_girl1/train/LJ048-0176.wav|1|Even if it were possible with a vastly larger force of security officers to do so, many observers have felt
e_girl1/train/LJ048-0186.wav|1|Instead of such advance precautions, the Secret Service depended in part on the efforts of local law enforcement personnel stationed along the route.
e_girl1/train/LJ048-0196.wav|1|According to Captain Lawrence, quote,
e_girl1/train/LJ048-0206.wav|1|As the motorcade approached Elm Street

e_girl1/train/LJ050-0078.wav|1|In June 1964, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies

e_girl1/train/LJ050-0208.wav|1|salaries are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.
e_girl1/train/LJ050-0218.wav|1|Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
e_girl1/train/LJ050-0228.wav|1|The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,

e_man1/train/LJ001-0090.wav|2|With this change the art of printing touched bottom,

e_man1/train/LJ002-0145.wav|2|Often a commissioner had to leave the bench because he was himself a party to the suit that was sub judice.
e_man1/train/LJ002-0155.wav|2|for which the costs were 6 shillings 10 pence.

e_man1/train/LJ002-0175.wav|2|The costs in heavier debts always doubled the sum; if the arrest was made in the country it trebled it.
e_man1/train/LJ002-0185.wav|2|The King's Bench was a national prison, in which were confined all debtors arrested for debt or for contempt of the court of the King's Bench.
e_man1/train/LJ002-0195.wav|2|Besides these, a number had the privilege of a "run on the key," which allowed a prisoner to go into the rules for the day.

e_man1/train/LJ002-0245.wav|2|The prison was a nest of abuses, like its neighbor the King's Bench
e_man1/train/LJ002-0255.wav|2|A court of the collegians was held every Monday to manage its affairs, at which all prisoners were required to attend.

e_man1/train/LJ002-0315.wav|2|But this weekly pittance did not go far when the debtors' side was crowded, as it often was;
e_man1/train/LJ002-0325.wav|2|or the sixpenny allowance was claimed for the creditors, which seldom happened, owing to the expense the process entailed.
e_man1/train/LJ002-0335.wav|2|so were candles, salt, pepper, mops and brooms. But the latter could have been of little service. Dirt prevailed everywhere;
e_man1/train/LJ003-0007.wav|2|hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there, and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtors' side.

e_man1/train/LJ003-0087.wav|2|These often remained in Newgate for six months, sometimes a year, in some cases longer;
e_man1/train/LJ003-0097.wav|2|with convicts of all ages and characters, to render it next to impossible but that, with the obliteration of all sense of self-respect,
e_man1/train/LJ003-0107.wav|2|he slept in the same bed with a highwayman on one side, and a man charged with murder on the other.
e_man1/train/LJ003-0117.wav|2|A bribe to the judge was certain to secure acquittal, and the neglect of the formality was as certainly followed by condemnation.

e_man1/train/LJ003-0217.wav|2|The condemned occupied an open pew in the center of the chapel, hung with black; in front of them, upon a table, was a black coffin in full view.
e_man1/train/LJ003-0227.wav|2|So unjust and unequal was the system, that the allowance to convicted criminals was better than that of the innocent debtor,
e_man1/train/LJ003-0237.wav|2|The fees on reception and discharge must be deemed exorbitant, when it is remembered the impoverished class who usually crowded the jail;
e_man1/train/LJ003-0247.wav|2|or the faithful discharge of some petty office, such as gatesman or captain of a ward.
e_man1/train/LJ003-0257.wav|2|Searches were made certainly, but they were too often superficial, or they might be evaded by a trifling bribe.

e_man1/train/LJ004-0090.wav|2|Again, the 22 Charles II. c 20 ordered the jailer to keep felons and debtors "separate and apart from one another,
e_man1/train/LJ004-0100.wav|2|An infirmary, consisting of two distinct rooms, one for males and one for females, should be provided for the separate accommodation of the sick.
e_man1/train/LJ004-0110.wav|2|It was made incumbent upon the justices to provide distinct places of confinement for five classes of prisoners, viz.

e_man1/train/LJ004-0200.wav|2|Another jail, that of Ilchester, was also worthy of all commendation. It exhibited all the good points of that at Bury.
e_man1/train/LJ004-0210.wav|2|There was a prison laundry too, where all the prisoners' linen was regularly washed.
e_man1/train/LJ004-0220.wav|2|for breakfast a pint of gruel; for dinner half a pound of boiled meat, or a quart of soup with vegetables, on alternate days.

e_man1/train/LJ005-0111.wav|2|In a county prison adjoining the metropolis, the separation between the male and female quarters was supposed to be accomplished by the erection of an iron railing;
e_man1/train/LJ005-0121.wav|2|By degrees, however,

e_man1/train/LJ005-0221.wav|2|and the panes were filled in with oiled paper, an insufficient protection against the weather;
e_man1/train/LJ005-0231.wav|2|The city justices had not fulfilled this obligation.

e_man1/train/LJ005-0261.wav|2|As a means of securing this uniformity,
e_man1/train/LJ005-0271.wav|2|As a means of increasing the severity of imprisonment, letters and visits from outside should not be permitted during the first six months of an imprisonment.

e_man1/train/LJ006-0031.wav|2|that punishment must be reformatory as well as deterrent.
e_man1/train/LJ006-0042.wav|2|Relapse was rapid and inevitable, so that the latter state of the prison was worse than the first.
e_man1/train/LJ006-0052.wav|2|The sum total thus produced was inconsiderable compared with the hundreds that had formerly filled the jail,
e_man1/train/LJ006-0062.wav|2|In another part there were men charged with and convicted of unnatural offenses shut up with lads of tender years;
e_man1/train/LJ006-0072.wav|2|I shall have occasion to speak again, and more at length, of Mr. Cope's careless and perfunctory discharge
e_man1/train/LJ006-0082.wav|2|and this particular official took excellent care to select as residents for his own ward those most suitable from his own point of view.
e_man1/train/LJ006-0092.wav|2|and under the scanty covering of a couple of dirty stable-rugs apiece.
e_man1/train/LJ006-0102.wav|2|This, too, was in the depth of the winter, and during a most inclement season.

e_man1/train/LJ006-0122.wav|2|and by these payments a wardsman had been known to amass as much as £40.
e_man1/train/LJ006-0132.wav|2|All the wardsmen alike were more or less irresponsible.
e_man1/train/LJ006-0142.wav|2|The matron deposed to having seen the gates-woman "exceedingly drunk," and having been insulted by her.
e_man1/train/LJ006-0152.wav|2|One turnkey had been so employed several hours daily for nearly eleven years.
e_man1/train/LJ006-0162.wav|2|But it is only fair to Mr. Cope to state that he himself said he went whenever he could find time
e_man1/train/LJ006-0172.wav|2|and evils that should have been speedily rooted out remained because they had the prescription of long usage.
e_man1/train/LJ006-0182.wav|2|Under the reckless contempt for regulations,
e_man1/train/LJ006-0192.wav|2|There was no school for adults; only the boys were taught anything, and their instructor, with his assistant, were convicted prisoners.
e_man1/train/LJ006-0202.wav|2|The news-vendor was also a tobacconist,
e_man1/train/LJ006-0212.wav|2|brought in beer for sale from a neighboring public-house, and visited all the wards with no other escort than the prisoner gatesman.

e_man1/train/LJ015-0309.wav|2|and the judge, in passing sentence on him of transportation for life, expressed deep regret that "the ingenuity, skill, and talent,

e_man1/train/LJ016-0065.wav|2|To walk out into the street was an easy affair, and he was now free, with one and fourpence in his pocket and a shirt and trousers for all his clothing.
e_man1/train/LJ016-0075.wav|2|It was for some time after this a constant practice to go up the chimneys in the hopes of escaping by the flue.

e_man1/train/LJ019-0045.wav|2|Not less remarkable than this diverse interpretation of a manifest duty
e_man1/train/LJ019-0055.wav|2|High authorities were in favor of continuous separation.

e_man1/train/LJ019-0125.wav|2|But an open farm of a thousand acres would have offered abundant chances of escape, which some at least would have attempted, probably with success.

e_man1/train/LJ024-0045.wav|2|if the appointment of such justices can be called "packing the Courts,"
e_man1/train/LJ024-0055.wav|2|We think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary

e_man1/train/LJ025-0052.wav|2|the greatest and most rapid revolution which biological science has ever undergone was effected by the application of the modern microscope
e_man1/train/LJ025-0062.wav|2|under particular circumstances, the contents of the cells of certain water-weeds were set free and moved about with considerable velocity
e_man1/train/LJ025-0072.wav|2|Hence the teleological argument for Cuvier's first diagnostic character
e_man1/train/LJ025-0082.wav|2|But although Cuvier's leading diagnosis of the animal from the plant will not stand a strict test,
e_man1/train/LJ025-0092.wav|2|It is now established that nitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter
e_man1/train/LJ025-0102.wav|2|yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy
e_man1/train/LJ025-0112.wav|2|With a qualification, to be considered presently, the answer to this question is undoubtedly in the affirmative.
e_man1/train/LJ025-0122.wav|2|The contractility which is the fundamental condition of locomotion," continues Huxley,
e_man1/train/LJ025-0132.wav|2|just as the body of a snail contracts into its shell when one of its "horns" is irritated.
e_man1/train/LJ025-0142.wav|2|greatly as these have been extended by modern improvements of the microscope, and that a nerve is, in its essence,
e_man1/train/LJ025-0152.wav|2|So that I know not where we can hope to find any absolute distinction between animals and plants, unless we return to their mode of nutrition
e_man1/train/LJ025-0162.wav|2|will be vastly greater than the weight of the same substances contained in the bean from which it sprang.
e_man1/train/LJ025-0172.wav|2|In fact, the bean obtains two of the absolutely indispensable elements of its substance from two distinct sources.
e_man1/train/LJ026-0006.wav|2|for the manufacture of starchy food from gaseous matter.
e_man1/train/LJ026-0016.wav|2|They ingest solid proteinaceous food,
e_man1/train/LJ026-0026.wav|2|As in the liquefaction of gases, there is a "critical point" at which the substance under experiment is neither gaseous nor liquid.
e_man1/train/LJ026-0036.wav|2|and then a balance must be struck and the doubtful form placed in the kingdom with which it has, on the whole, most points in common.

e_man1/train/LJ033-0167.wav|2|In addition the tape was compared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the bag had been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the Depository.

e_man1/train/LJ035-0105.wav|2|They took the east elevator to the seventh floor and ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several minutes.
e_man1/train/LJ035-0115.wav|2|Oswald's use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other employees in the building.
e_man1/train/LJ035-0125.wav|2|Victoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository Building,
e_man1/train/LJ035-0135.wav|2|ran up and said that the President had been shot.
e_man1/train/LJ035-0145.wav|2|Within a minute after Baker and Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical supervisor for the Texas School Book Depository,
e_man1/train/LJ035-0155.wav|2|The only exit from the office in the direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front stairway.
e_man1/train/LJ035-0165.wav|2|At that time the building had not yet been sealed off by the police.
e_man1/train/LJ035-0175.wav|2|The sergeant did the same thing at the rear of the building.
e_man1/train/LJ035-0185.wav|2|After inspecting this floor, Sawyer returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the building.
e_man1/train/LJ035-0195.wav|2|Satisfying himself that Oswald was missing, Truly obtained Oswald's address, phone number, and description from his employment application card.
e_man1/train/LJ035-0205.wav|2|and no one could be found who saw Oswald anywhere else in the building until after the shooting.
e_man1/train/LJ036-0005.wav|2|He arrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later.
e_man1/train/LJ036-0015.wav|2|According to the reconstruction of time and events which the Commission found most credible,
e_man1/train/LJ036-0025.wav|2|McWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time
e_man1/train/LJ036-0035.wav|2|The man was on the bus approximately 4 minutes.
e_man1/train/LJ036-0045.wav|2|Mrs. Bledsoe told him, quote, I am not going to rent to you any more, end quote,
e_man1/train/LJ036-0055.wav|2|Mrs. Bledsoe identified the shirt as the one Oswald was wearing and she stated she was certain that it was Oswald who boarded the bus.
e_man1/train/LJ036-0065.wav|2|Oswald lived at 1026 North Beckley.
e_man1/train/LJ036-0075.wav|2|walked seven blocks directly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately,
e_man1/train/LJ036-0085.wav|2|Oswald rose from his chair, looked directly at Fritz, and said, quote, Everybody will know who I am now, end quote,
e_man1/train/LJ036-0095.wav|2|but the Commission concluded that this man was not Lee Harvey Oswald,
e_man1/train/LJ036-0105.wav|2|He said, quote,
e_man1/train/LJ036-0115.wav|2|David Knapp, aged 18, was No. 2;
e_man1/train/LJ036-0125.wav|2|and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while at other times he waited to record three or four trips.
e_man1/train/LJ036-0135.wav|2|I started to that address, and the police cars, the sirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere, just a big uproar in that end of town and I said,
e_man1/train/LJ036-0145.wav|2|However, Neches and Beckley do not intersect.
e_man1/train/LJ036-0155.wav|2|Whaley testified that Oswald was wearing either the gray zippered jacket or the heavy blue jacket.

e_man1/train/LJ036-0185.wav|2|He hurried to his room and stayed no longer than 3 or 4 minutes.
e_man1/train/LJ036-0195.wav|2|He was described by Chief Curry as having the reputation of being "a very fine, dedicated officer."
e_man1/train/LJ036-0205.wav|2|Tippit must have heard the description of the suspect wanted for the President's shooting; it was broadcast over channel 1 at 12:45 p.m.,
e_man1/train/LJ036-0215.wav|2|He approached the car and apparently exchanged words with Tippit through the right front or vent window.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0007.wav|2|Three others subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0017.wav|2|The man cut across the yard through some bushes, passed within 12 feet of Scoggins, and ran south on Patton.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0027.wav|2|Benavides stopped and waited in the truck until the gunman ran to the corner.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0037.wav|2|As she waited on the northwest corner of the intersection for traffic to pass, she noticed a young man as he was, quote, almost ready to get up on the curb, end quote.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0047.wav|2|Mrs. Markham then ran to Officer Tippit's side and saw him lying in a pool of blood.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0057.wav|2|He said that Mrs. Markham started crying when Oswald walked into the lineup room.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0067.wav|2|the transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed state of his hair, a description fully supported by a photograph of Oswald
e_man1/train/LJ037-0077.wav|2|Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis, were in an apartment of a multiple-unit house on the southeast corner of 10th and Patton
e_man1/train/LJ037-0087.wav|2|I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When they made him turn sideways, I was positive that was the one I seen, end quote.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0097.wav|2|Smith subsequently told a Commission staff member
e_man1/train/LJ037-0107.wav|2|They saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver held high in his right hand. According to Callaway, the man crossed to the west side of Patton.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0117.wav|2|Both men picked Oswald as the man who had run south on Patton with a gun in his hand.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0127.wav|2|Four men -- Warren Reynolds, Harold Russell, Pat Patterson, and L. J. Lewis
e_man1/train/LJ037-0137.wav|2|He was then shown two photographs of Oswald and he advised that Oswald was, quote, unquestionably, end quote, the man he saw.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0147.wav|2|It was the unanimous and unequivocal testimony of expert witnesses before the Commission that these used cartridge cases were fired from the revolver

e_man1/train/LJ037-0207.wav|2|Michaelis furnished the shipping copy of the invoice, and the Railway Express Agency shipping documents, showing that
e_man1/train/LJ037-0217.wav|2|Police found an empty revolver holster when they searched Oswald's room on Beckley Avenue after his arrest.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0227.wav|2|Mrs. Markham told Poe
e_man1/train/LJ037-0237.wav|2|When interviewed by FBI agents on January 21, 1964,
e_man1/train/LJ037-0247.wav|2|Marina Oswald also identified Commission Exhibit No. 162, the jacket found by Captain Westbrook, as her husband's second jacket.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0257.wav|2|Scoggins thought it was lighter.
e_man1/train/LJ037-0267.wav|2|to the exclusion of all other weapons,
e_man1/train/LJ038-0008.wav|2|Brewer knew from radio broadcasts that the President had been shot and that a patrolman had also been shot in Oak Cliff.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0018.wav|2|Shortly thereafter, Johnny Brewer, who had come from the nearby shoestore, asked Mrs. Postal whether the fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0028.wav|2|Brewer met McDonald and the other policemen at the alley exit door,
e_man1/train/LJ038-0038.wav|2|McDonald struck back with his right hand and grabbed the gun with his left hand. They both fell into the seats.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0048.wav|2|Testimony of a firearms expert before the Commission established that the hammer of the revolver never touched the shell in the chamber.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0058.wav|2|Officer Ray Hawkins said
e_man1/train/LJ038-0068.wav|2|cursing a little bit and hollering police brutality, end quote.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0078.wav|2|Oswald was questioned intermittently for approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m., on November 22, and 11 a.m.,
e_man1/train/LJ038-0088.wav|2|The results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0098.wav|2|Denial of Rifle Ownership
e_man1/train/LJ038-0108.wav|2|that they had superimposed upon the photographs a rifle and a revolver. He told Fritz a number of times that the smaller photograph
e_man1/train/LJ038-0118.wav|2|The Aliases "Hidell" and "O. H. Lee"
e_man1/train/LJ038-0128.wav|2|He also denied that he had received the rifle through this box.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0138.wav|2|When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald lied again.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0148.wav|2|Actions During and After Shooting
e_man1/train/LJ038-0158.wav|2|Jarman testified that he ate his lunch on the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and that he neither ate lunch with nor saw Oswald.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0168.wav|2|There were no eyewitnesses, although a 14-year-old boy in a neighboring house claimed that immediately after the shooting

e_man1/train/LJ038-0200.wav|2|the city jail is located at the end of the bridge through which we always passed on going to the city (right in the beginning of the city after crossing the bridge).
e_man1/train/LJ038-0210.wav|2|according to Marina Oswald when he learned on the radio and in the newspapers the next day that he had missed,
e_man1/train/LJ038-0220.wav|2|Oswald had paid the first month's rent in advance on March 2, 1963,
e_man1/train/LJ038-0230.wav|2|The county jail is at the corner of Houston and Main Streets, quote, right in the beginning of the city, end quote, after one travels through the underpass.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0240.wav|2|The third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the entrance to General Walker's driveway from a back alley.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0250.wav|2|Another photograph of railroad tracks found among Oswald's possessions was not identified by his wife,
e_man1/train/LJ038-0260.wav|2|On November 30, 1963, the FBI requested the bullet for ballistics examination;
e_man1/train/LJ038-0270.wav|2|which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0280.wav|2|And for purposes of probative value, for whatever it might be worth,
e_man1/train/LJ038-0290.wav|2|provide important corroboration for her account of the incident.
e_man1/train/LJ038-0300.wav|2|Based on (1) the contents of the note which Oswald left for his wife on April 10, 1963,
e_man1/train/LJ039-0004.wav|2|Chapter 4. The Assassin: Part 8.
e_man1/train/LJ039-0014.wav|2|Marina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11, 1964,
e_man1/train/LJ039-0024.wav|2|She stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving the house. Quote, I couldn't keep him from going out if he really wanted to, end quote.
e_man1/train/LJ039-0034.wav|2|The Commission has concluded, therefore, that regardless of what Oswald may have said to his wife
e_man1/train/LJ039-0044.wav|2|Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit took place on April 23rd.
e_man1/train/LJ039-0054.wav|2|Oswald's Rifle Capability

e_man1/train/LJ039-0114.wav|2|When asked to explain the different scores achieved by Oswald on the two occasions when he fired for record,
e_man1/train/LJ039-0124.wav|2|End quote. Major Anderson concluded, quote, I would say that as compared to other Marines receiving the same type of training,
e_man1/train/LJ039-0134.wav|2|During one of his leaves from the Marines, Oswald hunted with his brother Robert,

e_man1/train/LJ039-0154.wav|2|4.8 to 5.6 seconds if the second shot missed,
e_man1/train/LJ039-0164.wav|2|from a tower at three silhouette targets at distances of 175, 240, and 265 feet.
e_man1/train/LJ039-0174.wav|2|The marksmen took as much time as they wanted for the first target and all hit the target.
e_man1/train/LJ039-0184.wav|2|Considering the various probabilities which may have prevailed during the actual assassination,
e_man1/train/LJ039-0194.wav|2|All three of the firers in these tests
e_man1/train/LJ039-0204.wav|2|Frazier later fired four groups of three shots at a distance of 100 yards in 5.9, 6.2,

e_man1/train/LJ039-0234.wav|2|the Commission concluded that Oswald was capable of accomplishing this second hit even if there was an intervening shot which missed.
e_man1/train/LJ039-0244.wav|2|killed Dallas Police Officer J. D. Tippit in an apparent attempt to escape,
e_man1/train/LJ040-0006.wav|2|The Commission has considered many possible motives for the assassination, including those which might flow from Oswald's commitment to Marxism or communism,
e_man1/train/LJ040-0016.wav|2|and in the history of his life which does give some insight into his character and, possibly, into the motives for his act.
e_man1/train/LJ040-0026.wav|2|He had very few, if any, close relationships with other people and he appeared to have great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world.
e_man1/train/LJ040-0036.wav|2|and, apparently seriously, as a political prophet -- a man who said that after 20 years he would be prime minister.

e_man1/train/LJ040-0076.wav|2|In the fall of that year John Pic and Robert Oswald went to a military academy
e_man1/train/LJ040-0086.wav|2|In the fall of 1948 she told John Pic and Robert Oswald
e_man1/train/LJ040-0096.wav|2|Pic said, quote,
e_man1/train/LJ040-0106.wav|2|It also appears that Lee tried to tag along with his older brothers
e_man1/train/LJ040-0116.wav|2|who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother, having struck her on at least one occasion.
e_man1/train/LJ040-0126.wav|2|Oswald was remanded for psychiatric observation to Youth House, an institution in which children are kept for psychiatric observation
e_man1/train/LJ040-0136.wav|2|There are children in here who have killed people, and smoke. I want to get out, end quote,
e_man1/train/LJ040-0146.wav|2|He noted that Lee liked to give the impression that he did not care for other people but preferred to keep to himself,
e_man1/train/LJ040-0156.wav|2|No finding of neurological impairment or psychotic mental changes could be made.
e_man1/train/LJ040-0166.wav|2|She also noted that there was, quote, a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved, affectionless youngster
e_man1/train/LJ040-0176.wav|2|He admitted to fantasies about being powerful and sometimes hurting and killing people, but refused to elaborate on them.
e_man1/train/LJ040-0186.wav|2|Lee scored an IQ of 118 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.
e_man1/train/LJ040-0196.wav|2|into which he appeared to be retreating.

e_man1/train/LJ040-0216.wav|2|In view of his experiences when he visited his relatives in New Orleans in the spring of 1950, and his other solitary habits,
e_man1/train/LJ040-0226.wav|2|I couldn't in all honesty sincerely say such a thing.
e_man1/train/LJ040-0236.wav|2|and when his mother failed to cooperate in any way with school authorities,
e_man1/train/LJ041-0006.wav|2|His mother exercised little control over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go on in school.
e_man1/train/LJ041-0016.wav|2|Voebel took Oswald back to the school to attend to his wounds, and their, quote, mild friendship, end quote, stemmed from that incident.
e_man1/train/LJ041-0026.wav|2|from which Oswald appeared to suffer.
e_man1/train/LJ041-0036.wav|2|He was a little dismayed at this, and he said that he couldn't find any that would show any interest in him as a Communist,
e_man1/train/LJ041-0046.wav|2|There is evidence that Oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join the Marines by the fact that his brother Robert had done so
e_man1/train/LJ041-0056.wav|2|in his intense desire to join the Marines and get away from his surroundings and his mother.
e_man1/train/LJ041-0066.wav|2|his general personality would alienate the group against him, end quote.
e_man1/train/LJ041-0076.wav|2|and put them in positions of prominence, end quote. Oswald manifested this feeling about authority by baiting his officers.
e_man1/train/LJ041-0086.wav|2|and then used the, quote, special treatment, end quote, he received as an example of the way in which he was being picked on and, quote,
e_man1/train/LJ041-0096.wav|2|Normally, it would be a good type of literature; and the one that I recall was "Leaves of Grass," by Walt Whitman, end quote.
e_man1/train/LJ041-0106.wav|2|At the court-martial hearing which followed, Oswald admitted that he had been rather drunk when the incident occurred.
e_man1/train/LJ041-0116.wav|2|after it was learned that he had defected to the Soviet Union.
e_man1/train/LJ041-0126.wav|2|But while we were in Russia he spoke well of him. Lee said that when he would return to the United States he would vote for him for Governor, end quote.

e_man1/train/LJ041-0166.wav|2|in honor of some retiring noncommissioned officers, an event which they both approached with little enthusiasm.
e_man1/train/LJ041-0176.wav|2|He recalled that Oswald had a specific interest in Latin America, particularly Cuba,
e_man1/train/LJ041-0186.wav|2|as some kind of tribunal,
e_man1/train/LJ041-0196.wav|2|even though as his wife suggested, that interest may have been motivated by a desire to gain attention. He used his Marxist and associated activities

e_man1/train/LJ042-0033.wav|2|of his concomitant hatred of the United States, which was most clearly expressed in his November 26,

e_man1/train/LJ042-0134.wav|2|The psychological effects of that change must have been highly unsettling. It should be remembered
e_man1/train/LJ042-0144.wav|2|After the assassination she wrote that, quote,

e_man1/train/LJ043-0044.wav|2|The latter testified that they, quote, were just together again, end quote, as if his brother, quote, had not been to Russia, end quote.
e_man1/train/LJ043-0054.wav|2|Oswald moved to Dallas on about October 8, 1962, without telling his mother where he was going.

e_man1/train/LJ043-0114.wav|2|Oswald told his wife and Mrs. Paine that he was working as a commercial photographer.
e_man1/train/LJ043-0124.wav|2|Ironically, he failed to get a job in another photographic firm after his return to Dallas in October of 1963,

e_man1/train/LJ044-0026.wav|2|Marina Oswald said she signed that name, apparently chosen because it rhymed with "Fidel,"

e_man1/train/LJ044-0047.wav|2|that anyone ever attacked any street demonstration in which Oswald was involved, except for the Bringuier incident mentioned above,
e_man1/train/LJ044-0057.wav|2|extensive investigation was not able to connect Oswald with that address, although it did develop the fact

e_man1/train/LJ044-0077.wav|2|This would have made him a real center of attention as he must have been when he first arrived in the Soviet Union
e_man1/train/LJ044-0087.wav|2|Oswald was confronted with those facts at the beginning of the debate and was so thrown on the defensive by this that he was forced to state that
e_man1/train/LJ044-0097.wav|2|Stuckey thought Oswald, quote, appeared to be a very logical, intelligent fellow, end quote, and, quote, was arrested by his cleancutness, end quote.
e_man1/train/LJ044-0107.wav|2|and advised them of some of his activities on behalf of the organization.
e_man1/train/LJ044-0117.wav|2|that there were people who understood his activity, end quote.
e_man1/train/LJ044-0127.wav|2|In reply Arnold Johnson advised Oswald that, while as an American citizen he had a right to participate in such organizations as he wished, quote,
e_man1/train/LJ044-0137.wav|2|More seriously, the facts of his defection had become known, leaving him open to almost unanswerable attack by those who opposed his views.
e_man1/train/LJ044-0147.wav|2|and in late June or early July he told his wife that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union with her. She said that he was extremely upset,
e_man1/train/LJ044-0157.wav|2|he requested the Embassy to rush his wife's entrance visa because of the impending birth of the second child but stated that, quote,
e_man1/train/LJ044-0167.wav|2|He asked his wife to help him to hijack an airplane to get there, but gave up that scheme when she refused.

e_man1/train/LJ044-0197.wav|2|It should be noted that his interest in Cuba seems to have increased along with the sense of frustration which must have developed
e_man1/train/LJ044-0207.wav|2|the economic embargo against that country, and the general policy of the United States with regard to Cuba.
e_man1/train/LJ044-0218.wav|2|In this connection it should be noted that in speaking of the Worker, Oswald told Michael Paine, apparently in all seriousness, that, quote,
e_man1/train/LJ044-0228.wav|2|it should be remembered that his wife testified that he was disappointed with his failure to get to Cuba
e_man1/train/LJ044-0238.wav|2|The fact that Oswald left behind the funds which might have enabled him to reach Cuba suggests the absence of any plan to try to flee there

e_man1/train/LJ045-0049.wav|2|Lee would say that it would be better for me if I went to Russia. I did not know why. I did not know what he had in mind.
e_man1/train/LJ045-0059.wav|2|The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.

e_man1/train/LJ045-0169.wav|2|That this was better because while he was living alone and I stayed with Ruth, we were spending less money. And I told him to buy me a washing machine, because two children
e_man1/train/LJ045-0179.wav|2|He took with him $13.87 and the long brown package that Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw him carry
e_man1/train/LJ045-0189.wav|2|it should be noted that mention of the Trade Mart as the expected site of the Presidential luncheon
e_man1/train/LJ045-0199.wav|2|Whether he thought about assassinating the President over the weekend can never be known, but it is reasonably certain
e_man1/train/LJ045-0209.wav|2|but it was also, at least in part, because his wife did not want to live there with him.
e_man1/train/LJ045-0219.wav|2|that he wanted to make peace with her and bring his family to Dallas where they could live with him again.
e_man1/train/LJ045-0229.wav|2|He then killed Patrolman Tippit when that police officer apparently tried to question him after he had left his roominghouse and he vigorously resisted arrest
e_man1/train/LJ045-0239.wav|2|which has been set forth above, only served to prolong the period during which he was the center of the attention of the entire world.
e_man1/train/LJ045-0249.wav|2|Out of these and the many other factors which may have molded the character of Lee Harvey Oswald
e_man1/train/LJ046-0009.wav|2|when visiting Miami on February 15, 1933; and on President Harry S. Truman on November 1, 1950,
e_man1/train/LJ046-0019.wav|2|In this part of its inquiry the Commission has had full access to a major study of all phases of protective activities
e_man1/train/LJ046-0029.wav|2|It is unlikely that measures can be devised to eliminate entirely the multitude of diverse dangers that may arise,
e_man1/train/LJ046-0039.wav|2|As the ceremonial head of the Government the President must discharge a wide range of public duties, not only in Washington but throughout the land.
e_man1/train/LJ046-0049.wav|2|More often than not, Presidential journeys have served more than one purpose at the same time: ceremonial,

e_man1/train/LJ046-0179.wav|2|being reviewed regularly.
e_man1/train/LJ046-0189.wav|2|PRS had received, over a 20-year period, basic information on some 50,000 cases;
e_man1/train/LJ046-0199.wav|2|The general files of PRS were not indexed by geographic location and were of little use in preparing for a Presidential visit to a specific locality.
e_man1/train/LJ046-0209.wav|2|In the absence of more specific instructions, other Federal agencies interpreted the Secret Service's informal requests
e_man1/train/LJ046-0219.wav|2|The above action should be taken without delay in order to attempt to verify the information and no evaluation of the information should be attempted.
e_man1/train/LJ046-0229.wav|2|The Commission believes that the facilities and procedures of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service

e_man1/train/LJ046-0249.wav|2|about persons other than those who were obvious threats to the President.
e_man1/train/LJ047-0005.wav|2|Oswald was known to other Federal agencies with which the Secret Service maintained intelligence liaison.
e_man1/train/LJ047-0015.wav|2|From defection to return to Fort Worth.
e_man1/train/LJ047-0025.wav|2|During the next 2 years the FBI continued to accumulate information,
e_man1/train/LJ047-0035.wav|2|Oswald's file at the Department of State Passport Office was reviewed in June 1962.
e_man1/train/LJ047-0045.wav|2|and promised to advise the FBI if he heard from them.
e_man1/train/LJ047-0055.wav|2|It does not preclude the agent in charge of the case from reopening it if he feels that further work should be done.
e_man1/train/LJ047-0065.wav|2|This information led Hosty to review Oswald's file, from which he learned that Oswald had become a subscriber to the Worker,
e_man1/train/LJ047-0075.wav|2|Hosty had inquired earlier and found no evidence that it was functioning in the Dallas area.
e_man1/train/LJ047-0085.wav|2|The FBI had not asked to be informed of any effort by Oswald to obtain a passport,
e_man1/train/LJ047-0095.wav|2|On the next day, he asked the New Orleans police to arrange for him to be interviewed by the FBI.
e_man1/train/LJ047-0105.wav|2|In Quigley's judgment,
e_man1/train/LJ047-0115.wav|2|Several days later, the Bureau received additional evidence that Oswald had lied to Agent Quigley.
e_man1/train/LJ047-0125.wav|2|In other words, he committed no violation of the law by telling us something that wasn't true, and unless this required further investigation at that time,
e_man1/train/LJ047-0135.wav|2|According to the information received by the Bureau
e_man1/train/LJ047-0145.wav|2|The CIA message was sent also to the Department of State where it was reviewed by personnel of the Passport Office, who knew from Oswald's file

e_man1/train/LJ047-0165.wav|2|At the end of the interview, Marina Oswald came into the room. When he observed that she seemed, quote, quite alarmed, end quote, about the visit,

e_man1/train/LJ047-0215.wav|2|including the significant fact that Oswald was employed in a building which overlooked the motorcade route.
e_man1/train/LJ047-0225.wav|2|Hosty testified that he did not know until the evening of Thursday, November 21, that there was to be a motorcade, however,
e_man1/train/LJ047-0235.wav|2|complete surprise, end quote, because he had no reason to believe that Oswald, quote,
e_man1/train/LJ047-0245.wav|2|His secretary testified that she prepared such a report for him that afternoon and Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry
e_man1/train/LJ048-0005.wav|2|There was nothing up to the time of the assassination that gave any indication that this man was a dangerous character who might do harm to the President
e_man1/train/LJ048-0015.wav|2|We talked to him twice.
e_man1/train/LJ048-0025.wav|2|and had told Mrs. Paine that when he got the money he was going to take an apartment, when the baby was old enough, he was going to take an apartment, and the family would live together.

e_man1/train/LJ048-0055.wav|2|a more alert and carefully considered treatment of the Oswald case by the Bureau might have brought about such a referral.

e_man1/train/LJ048-0095.wav|2|The Service prefers to have two agents perform advance preparations.
e_man1/train/LJ048-0105.wav|2|but these routes would not have been in accordance with the White House staff instructions given the Secret Service for a desirable motorcade route.
e_man1/train/LJ048-0116.wav|2|Agent Lawson was not given written instructions concerning the Dallas trip or advice about any peculiar problems which it might involve;
e_man1/train/LJ048-0126.wav|2|Special Agent in Charge Sorrels testified that the advance preparations followed on this occasion were, quote, pretty much the same, end quote,
e_man1/train/LJ048-0136.wav|2|In the description of the important aspects of the advance preparations,
e_man1/train/LJ048-0146.wav|2|Discussions with the Dallas authorities and requests made of them were entirely informal.
e_man1/train/LJ048-0156.wav|2|and suggested the desirability of such a statement.
e_man1/train/LJ048-0166.wav|2|But on out-of-town trips where the route is decided on and made public only a few days in advance,
e_man1/train/LJ048-0176.wav|2|Even if it were possible with a vastly larger force of security officers to do so, many observers have felt
e_man1/train/LJ048-0186.wav|2|Instead of such advance precautions, the Secret Service depended in part on the efforts of local law enforcement personnel stationed along the route.
e_man1/train/LJ048-0196.wav|2|According to Captain Lawrence, quote,
e_man1/train/LJ048-0206.wav|2|As the motorcade approached Elm Street
e_man1/train/LJ048-0216.wav|2|stated that he scanned the Depository Building, but not sufficiently to be alerted by anything in the windows or on the roof.
e_man1/train/LJ048-0226.wav|2|All of the agents stayed for a drink of beer, or in several cases, a mixed drink.
e_man1/train/LJ048-0236.wav|2|There is no indication that any of the agents who visited the Cellar Coffee House had any intoxicating drink at that establishment.
e_man1/train/LJ048-0246.wav|2|Each of the agents who visited the Press Club or the Cellar Coffee House (apart from the three members of the midnight shift)
e_man1/train/LJ048-0256.wav|2|as a result of the investigation he ordered, he was satisfied that each of the agents performed his duties in an entirely satisfactory manner
e_man1/train/LJ048-0266.wav|2|and special agents cooperating with them on Presidential and similar protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for official duty
e_man1/train/LJ048-0276.wav|2|Since he was convinced that this was not the case, he believed that it would be unfair to the agents and their families to take explicit disciplinary measures.
e_man1/train/LJ048-0286.wav|2|Nor is this goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours, and lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep.

e_man1/train/LJ049-0148.wav|2|For various reasons the Secret Service has functioned largely as an informal part of the White House staff, with the result

e_man1/train/LJ050-0018.wav|2|and to keep the Secretary fully informed regarding all significant developments relating to Presidential protection.

e_man1/train/LJ050-0038.wav|2|In attempting to identify those individuals who might prove a danger to the President,
e_man1/train/LJ050-0048.wav|2|It has received assistance also from data processing experts at the CIA
e_man1/train/LJ050-0058.wav|2|which was the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the President.
e_man1/train/LJ050-0068.wav|2|According to Chief Rowley, by mid-June 1964,
e_man1/train/LJ050-0078.wav|2|In June 1964, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies
e_man1/train/LJ050-0088.wav|2|to further the intention to satisfy a grievance by unlawful means.

e_man1/train/LJ050-0108.wav|2|The Secret Service's liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has been too casual.
e_man1/train/LJ050-0118.wav|2|Since these agencies are already obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups,
e_man1/train/LJ050-0128.wav|2|Much useful information will come to the attention of local law enforcement agencies in the regular course of their activities,

e_man1/train/LJ050-0168.wav|2|with the particular purposes of the agency involved. The Commission recognizes that this is a controversial area

e_woman1/train/LJ002-0185.wav|3|The King's Bench was a national prison, in which were confined all debtors arrested for debt or for contempt of the court of the King's Bench.
e_woman1/train/LJ002-0195.wav|3|Besides these, a number had the privilege of a "run on the key," which allowed a prisoner to go into the rules for the day.

e_woman1/train/LJ002-0325.wav|3|or the sixpenny allowance was claimed for the creditors, which seldom happened, owing to the expense the process entailed.
e_woman1/train/LJ002-0335.wav|3|so were candles, salt, pepper, mops and brooms. But the latter could have been of little service. Dirt prevailed everywhere;
e_woman1/train/LJ003-0007.wav|3|hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there, and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtors' side.

e_woman1/train/LJ003-0227.wav|3|So unjust and unequal was the system, that the allowance to convicted criminals was better than that of the innocent debtor,
e_woman1/train/LJ003-0237.wav|3|The fees on reception and discharge must be deemed exorbitant, when it is remembered the impoverished class who usually crowded the jail;

e_woman1/train/LJ003-0257.wav|3|Searches were made certainly, but they were too often superficial, or they might be evaded by a trifling bribe.

e_woman1/train/LJ004-0090.wav|3|Again, the 22 Charles II. c 20 ordered the jailer to keep felons and debtors "separate and apart from one another,

e_woman1/train/LJ004-0200.wav|3|Another jail, that of Ilchester, was also worthy of all commendation. It exhibited all the good points of that at Bury.
e_woman1/train/LJ004-0210.wav|3|There was a prison laundry too, where all the prisoners' linen was regularly washed.
e_woman1/train/LJ004-0220.wav|3|for breakfast a pint of gruel; for dinner half a pound of boiled meat, or a quart of soup with vegetables, on alternate days.

e_woman1/train/LJ005-0111.wav|3|In a county prison adjoining the metropolis, the separation between the male and female quarters was supposed to be accomplished by the erection of an iron railing;
e_woman1/train/LJ005-0121.wav|3|By degrees, however,

e_woman1/train/LJ005-0211.wav|3|the jail consisted of six cells, frequently so damp that the moisture trickled down the walls; there was not space for air or exercise,
e_woman1/train/LJ005-0221.wav|3|and the panes were filled in with oiled paper, an insufficient protection against the weather;
e_woman1/train/LJ005-0231.wav|3|The city justices had not fulfilled this obligation.

e_woman1/train/LJ005-0261.wav|3|As a means of securing this uniformity,
e_woman1/train/LJ005-0271.wav|3|As a means of increasing the severity of imprisonment, letters and visits from outside should not be permitted during the first six months of an imprisonment.

e_woman1/train/LJ006-0031.wav|3|that punishment must be reformatory as well as deterrent.
e_woman1/train/LJ006-0042.wav|3|Relapse was rapid and inevitable, so that the latter state of the prison was worse than the first.
e_woman1/train/LJ006-0052.wav|3|The sum total thus produced was inconsiderable compared with the hundreds that had formerly filled the jail,
e_woman1/train/LJ006-0062.wav|3|In another part there were men charged with and convicted of unnatural offenses shut up with lads of tender years;
e_woman1/train/LJ006-0072.wav|3|I shall have occasion to speak again, and more at length, of Mr. Cope's careless and perfunctory discharge
e_woman1/train/LJ006-0082.wav|3|and this particular official took excellent care to select as residents for his own ward those most suitable from his own point of view.
e_woman1/train/LJ006-0092.wav|3|and under the scanty covering of a couple of dirty stable-rugs apiece.
e_woman1/train/LJ006-0102.wav|3|This, too, was in the depth of the winter, and during a most inclement season.

e_woman1/train/LJ006-0122.wav|3|and by these payments a wardsman had been known to amass as much as £40.
e_woman1/train/LJ006-0132.wav|3|All the wardsmen alike were more or less irresponsible.

e_woman1/train/LJ006-0182.wav|3|Under the reckless contempt for regulations,
e_woman1/train/LJ006-0192.wav|3|There was no school for adults; only the boys were taught anything, and their instructor, with his assistant, were convicted prisoners.
e_woman1/train/LJ006-0202.wav|3|The news-vendor was also a tobacconist,

e_woman1/train/LJ010-0099.wav|3|The conspirators were in a loft, approached by a ladder and a trap-door, access through which could only be obtained one by one.
e_woman1/train/LJ010-0109.wav|3|Thistlewood made a long and rambling defense, the chief features of which were abuse of Lord Sidmouth, and the vilification of the informer Edwards.

e_woman1/train/LJ014-0277.wav|3|An inquiry was at once set on foot, and the frauds were traced to Watts.
e_woman1/train/LJ014-0288.wav|3|That same evening he committed suicide in Newgate.

e_woman1/train/LJ015-0009.wav|3|Cole's difficulties increased more and more; warrant-holders came down upon him demanding to realize their goods.

e_woman1/train/LJ015-0159.wav|3|In his person he was neat and fastidious;

e_woman1/train/LJ015-0219.wav|3|At last he decided to enlist one Tester, a clerk in the traffic department, whom he thought would prove a likely tool.
e_woman1/train/LJ015-0229.wav|3|who quickly took the wax impression, handed it back to Pierce; Pierce replaced it, left the office, and the thing was done.
e_woman1/train/LJ015-0239.wav|3|Just as the train was starting Agar slipped into the van with Burgess, and Pierce got into a first-class carriage.
e_woman1/train/LJ015-0249.wav|3|The theft was discovered at Boulogne, when the boxes were found not to weigh exactly what they ought. But no clue was obtained to the thieves,
e_woman1/train/LJ015-0259.wav|3|Agar too, in Newgate, heard how Pierce had treated him, and at once readily turned approver.
e_woman1/train/LJ015-0269.wav|3|He was known to the whole criminal fraternity as a high-class receiver of stolen goods, a negotiator more especially of stolen paper,

e_woman1/train/LJ015-0289.wav|3|As each transaction was carried out from a different address, and a different messenger always employed,
e_woman1/train/LJ015-0299.wav|3|and the circumstances were deemed sufficiently suspicious to warrant the arrest of the gentlemen at Yarmouth on a charge of forgery and conspiracy.
e_woman1/train/LJ015-0309.wav|3|and the judge, in passing sentence on him of transportation for life, expressed deep regret that "the ingenuity, skill, and talent,

e_woman1/train/LJ016-0065.wav|3|To walk out into the street was an easy affair, and he was now free, with one and fourpence in his pocket and a shirt and trousers for all his clothing.
e_woman1/train/LJ016-0075.wav|3|It was for some time after this a constant practice to go up the chimneys in the hopes of escaping by the flue.

e_woman1/train/LJ016-0216.wav|3|That very ancient perquisite the convict's clothes was never claimed by Calcraft, and it may be doubted whether he was entitled to it.
e_woman1/train/LJ016-0226.wav|3|To this curious etiquette was due the appointment of an official whose office has long since disappeared, "the yeoman of the halter,"

e_woman1/train/LJ016-0359.wav|3|Private executions at their first introduction were not popular with the Newgate officials, and for intelligible reasons.
e_woman1/train/LJ016-0369.wav|3|upon them devolved the painful duty of cutting down the body and preparing for the inquest.

e_woman1/train/LJ019-0035.wav|3|and the total number of separate cells provided amounted to eleven thousand odd.
e_woman1/train/LJ019-0045.wav|3|Not less remarkable than this diverse interpretation of a manifest duty
e_woman1/train/LJ019-0055.wav|3|High authorities were in favor of continuous separation.

e_woman1/train/LJ019-0125.wav|3|But an open farm of a thousand acres would have offered abundant chances of escape, which some at least would have attempted, probably with success.

e_woman1/train/LJ019-0145.wav|3|But reformation was only skin deep. Below the surface many of the old evils still rankled.
e_woman1/train/LJ019-0155.wav|3|The enforcement of discipline depended upon the want of honor among thieves.
e_woman1/train/LJ019-0165.wav|3|The rule became general as regards the prison dress; hitherto clothing had been issued only to such as were destitute or in rags, and all classes of prisoners,

e_woman1/train/LJ019-0205.wav|3|In 1845 the Jail Committee brought forward a definite proposal to purchase ground in the immediate vicinity for the erection of a new jail.

e_woman1/train/LJ019-0245.wav|3|The inquiry was most searching and complete, and the committee spoke plainly in its report.

e_woman1/train/LJ024-0045.wav|3|if the appointment of such justices can be called "packing the Courts,"
e_woman1/train/LJ024-0055.wav|3|We think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary

e_woman1/train/LJ025-0022.wav|3|From the mobility of animals Cuvier, with his characteristic partiality for teleological reasoning,

e_woman1/train/LJ025-0052.wav|3|the greatest and most rapid revolution which biological science has ever undergone was effected by the application of the modern microscope
e_woman1/train/LJ025-0062.wav|3|under particular circumstances, the contents of the cells of certain water-weeds were set free and moved about with considerable velocity
e_woman1/train/LJ025-0072.wav|3|Hence the teleological argument for Cuvier's first diagnostic character
e_woman1/train/LJ025-0082.wav|3|But although Cuvier's leading diagnosis of the animal from the plant will not stand a strict test,
e_woman1/train/LJ025-0092.wav|3|It is now established that nitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter
e_woman1/train/LJ025-0102.wav|3|yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy
e_woman1/train/LJ025-0112.wav|3|With a qualification, to be considered presently, the answer to this question is undoubtedly in the affirmative.
e_woman1/train/LJ025-0122.wav|3|The contractility which is the fundamental condition of locomotion," continues Huxley,
e_woman1/train/LJ025-0132.wav|3|just as the body of a snail contracts into its shell when one of its "horns" is irritated.

e_woman1/train/LJ025-0152.wav|3|So that I know not where we can hope to find any absolute distinction between animals and plants, unless we return to their mode of nutrition
e_woman1/train/LJ025-0162.wav|3|will be vastly greater than the weight of the same substances contained in the bean from which it sprang.
e_woman1/train/LJ025-0172.wav|3|In fact, the bean obtains two of the absolutely indispensable elements of its substance from two distinct sources.
e_woman1/train/LJ026-0006.wav|3|for the manufacture of starchy food from gaseous matter.
e_woman1/train/LJ026-0016.wav|3|They ingest solid proteinaceous food,
e_woman1/train/LJ026-0026.wav|3|As in the liquefaction of gases, there is a "critical point" at which the substance under experiment is neither gaseous nor liquid.
e_woman1/train/LJ026-0036.wav|3|and then a balance must be struck and the doubtful form placed in the kingdom with which it has, on the whole, most points in common.

e_woman1/train/LJ033-0167.wav|3|In addition the tape was compared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the bag had been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the Depository.

e_woman1/train/LJ034-0113.wav|3|The autopsy report indicated an estimated weight of 150 pounds.
e_woman1/train/LJ034-0123.wav|3|Although Brennan testified that the man in the window was standing when he fired the shots, most probably he was either sitting or kneeling.

e_woman1/train/LJ035-0055.wav|3|Along a side wall of the lunchroom was a soft drink rending machine, but at that time the man had nothing in his hands.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0065.wav|3|Truly also noted at this time that Oswald's hands were empty.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0075.wav|3|A test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom by stairway.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0085.wav|3|from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the stairway to the lunchroom.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0095.wav|3|That Oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0105.wav|3|They took the east elevator to the seventh floor and ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several minutes.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0115.wav|3|Oswald's use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other employees in the building.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0125.wav|3|Victoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository Building,
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0135.wav|3|ran up and said that the President had been shot.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0145.wav|3|Within a minute after Baker and Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical supervisor for the Texas School Book Depository,
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0155.wav|3|The only exit from the office in the direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front stairway.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0165.wav|3|At that time the building had not yet been sealed off by the police.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0175.wav|3|The sergeant did the same thing at the rear of the building.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0185.wav|3|After inspecting this floor, Sawyer returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the building.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0195.wav|3|Satisfying himself that Oswald was missing, Truly obtained Oswald's address, phone number, and description from his employment application card.
e_woman1/train/LJ035-0205.wav|3|and no one could be found who saw Oswald anywhere else in the building until after the shooting.
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0005.wav|3|He arrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later.
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0015.wav|3|According to the reconstruction of time and events which the Commission found most credible,
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0025.wav|3|McWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0035.wav|3|The man was on the bus approximately 4 minutes.
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0045.wav|3|Mrs. Bledsoe told him, quote, I am not going to rent to you any more, end quote,
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0055.wav|3|Mrs. Bledsoe identified the shirt as the one Oswald was wearing and she stated she was certain that it was Oswald who boarded the bus.
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0065.wav|3|Oswald lived at 1026 North Beckley.
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0075.wav|3|walked seven blocks directly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately,
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0085.wav|3|Oswald rose from his chair, looked directly at Fritz, and said, quote, Everybody will know who I am now, end quote,
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0095.wav|3|but the Commission concluded that this man was not Lee Harvey Oswald,
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0105.wav|3|He said, quote,
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0115.wav|3|David Knapp, aged 18, was No. 2;
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0125.wav|3|and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while at other times he waited to record three or four trips.
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0135.wav|3|I started to that address, and the police cars, the sirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere, just a big uproar in that end of town and I said,
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0145.wav|3|However, Neches and Beckley do not intersect.
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0155.wav|3|Whaley testified that Oswald was wearing either the gray zippered jacket or the heavy blue jacket.

e_woman1/train/LJ036-0175.wav|3|Arrival and departure from roominghouse.
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0185.wav|3|He hurried to his room and stayed no longer than 3 or 4 minutes.
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0195.wav|3|He was described by Chief Curry as having the reputation of being "a very fine, dedicated officer."
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0205.wav|3|Tippit must have heard the description of the suspect wanted for the President's shooting; it was broadcast over channel 1 at 12:45 p.m.,
e_woman1/train/LJ036-0215.wav|3|He approached the car and apparently exchanged words with Tippit through the right front or vent window.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0007.wav|3|Three others subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0017.wav|3|The man cut across the yard through some bushes, passed within 12 feet of Scoggins, and ran south on Patton.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0027.wav|3|Benavides stopped and waited in the truck until the gunman ran to the corner.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0037.wav|3|As she waited on the northwest corner of the intersection for traffic to pass, she noticed a young man as he was, quote, almost ready to get up on the curb, end quote.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0047.wav|3|Mrs. Markham then ran to Officer Tippit's side and saw him lying in a pool of blood.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0057.wav|3|He said that Mrs. Markham started crying when Oswald walked into the lineup room.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0067.wav|3|the transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed state of his hair, a description fully supported by a photograph of Oswald
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0077.wav|3|Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis, were in an apartment of a multiple-unit house on the southeast corner of 10th and Patton
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0087.wav|3|I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When they made him turn sideways, I was positive that was the one I seen, end quote.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0097.wav|3|Smith subsequently told a Commission staff member
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0107.wav|3|They saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver held high in his right hand. According to Callaway, the man crossed to the west side of Patton.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0117.wav|3|Both men picked Oswald as the man who had run south on Patton with a gun in his hand.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0127.wav|3|Four men -- Warren Reynolds, Harold Russell, Pat Patterson, and L. J. Lewis
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0137.wav|3|He was then shown two photographs of Oswald and he advised that Oswald was, quote, unquestionably, end quote, the man he saw.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0147.wav|3|It was the unanimous and unequivocal testimony of expert witnesses before the Commission that these used cartridge cases were fired from the revolver
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0157.wav|3|taken from Oswald.

e_woman1/train/LJ037-0197.wav|3|and the return address was Post Office Box 2915, Dallas, Texas.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0207.wav|3|Michaelis furnished the shipping copy of the invoice, and the Railway Express Agency shipping documents, showing that
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0217.wav|3|Police found an empty revolver holster when they searched Oswald's room on Beckley Avenue after his arrest.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0227.wav|3|Mrs. Markham told Poe
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0237.wav|3|When interviewed by FBI agents on January 21, 1964,
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0247.wav|3|Marina Oswald also identified Commission Exhibit No. 162, the jacket found by Captain Westbrook, as her husband's second jacket.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0257.wav|3|Scoggins thought it was lighter.
e_woman1/train/LJ037-0267.wav|3|to the exclusion of all other weapons,
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0008.wav|3|Brewer knew from radio broadcasts that the President had been shot and that a patrolman had also been shot in Oak Cliff.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0018.wav|3|Shortly thereafter, Johnny Brewer, who had come from the nearby shoestore, asked Mrs. Postal whether the fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0028.wav|3|Brewer met McDonald and the other policemen at the alley exit door,
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0038.wav|3|McDonald struck back with his right hand and grabbed the gun with his left hand. They both fell into the seats.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0048.wav|3|Testimony of a firearms expert before the Commission established that the hammer of the revolver never touched the shell in the chamber.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0058.wav|3|Officer Ray Hawkins said
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0068.wav|3|cursing a little bit and hollering police brutality, end quote.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0078.wav|3|Oswald was questioned intermittently for approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m., on November 22, and 11 a.m.,
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0088.wav|3|The results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0098.wav|3|Denial of Rifle Ownership
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0108.wav|3|that they had superimposed upon the photographs a rifle and a revolver. He told Fritz a number of times that the smaller photograph
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0118.wav|3|The Aliases "Hidell" and "O. H. Lee"
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0128.wav|3|He also denied that he had received the rifle through this box.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0138.wav|3|When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald lied again.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0148.wav|3|Actions During and After Shooting
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0158.wav|3|Jarman testified that he ate his lunch on the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and that he neither ate lunch with nor saw Oswald.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0168.wav|3|There were no eyewitnesses, although a 14-year-old boy in a neighboring house claimed that immediately after the shooting

e_woman1/train/LJ038-0200.wav|3|the city jail is located at the end of the bridge through which we always passed on going to the city (right in the beginning of the city after crossing the bridge).
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0210.wav|3|according to Marina Oswald when he learned on the radio and in the newspapers the next day that he had missed,
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0220.wav|3|Oswald had paid the first month's rent in advance on March 2, 1963,
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0230.wav|3|The county jail is at the corner of Houston and Main Streets, quote, right in the beginning of the city, end quote, after one travels through the underpass.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0240.wav|3|The third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the entrance to General Walker's driveway from a back alley.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0250.wav|3|Another photograph of railroad tracks found among Oswald's possessions was not identified by his wife,
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0260.wav|3|On November 30, 1963, the FBI requested the bullet for ballistics examination;
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0270.wav|3|which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0280.wav|3|And for purposes of probative value, for whatever it might be worth,
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0290.wav|3|provide important corroboration for her account of the incident.
e_woman1/train/LJ038-0300.wav|3|Based on (1) the contents of the note which Oswald left for his wife on April 10, 1963,
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0004.wav|3|Chapter 4. The Assassin: Part 8.
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0014.wav|3|Marina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11, 1964,
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0024.wav|3|She stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving the house. Quote, I couldn't keep him from going out if he really wanted to, end quote.
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0034.wav|3|The Commission has concluded, therefore, that regardless of what Oswald may have said to his wife
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0044.wav|3|Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit took place on April 23rd.
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0054.wav|3|Oswald's Rifle Capability

e_woman1/train/LJ039-0114.wav|3|When asked to explain the different scores achieved by Oswald on the two occasions when he fired for record,
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0124.wav|3|End quote. Major Anderson concluded, quote, I would say that as compared to other Marines receiving the same type of training,
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0134.wav|3|During one of his leaves from the Marines, Oswald hunted with his brother Robert,

e_woman1/train/LJ039-0154.wav|3|4.8 to 5.6 seconds if the second shot missed,
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0164.wav|3|from a tower at three silhouette targets at distances of 175, 240, and 265 feet.
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0174.wav|3|The marksmen took as much time as they wanted for the first target and all hit the target.
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0184.wav|3|Considering the various probabilities which may have prevailed during the actual assassination,
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0194.wav|3|All three of the firers in these tests
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0204.wav|3|Frazier later fired four groups of three shots at a distance of 100 yards in 5.9, 6.2,

e_woman1/train/LJ039-0234.wav|3|the Commission concluded that Oswald was capable of accomplishing this second hit even if there was an intervening shot which missed.
e_woman1/train/LJ039-0244.wav|3|killed Dallas Police Officer J. D. Tippit in an apparent attempt to escape,
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0006.wav|3|The Commission has considered many possible motives for the assassination, including those which might flow from Oswald's commitment to Marxism or communism,
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0016.wav|3|and in the history of his life which does give some insight into his character and, possibly, into the motives for his act.
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0026.wav|3|He had very few, if any, close relationships with other people and he appeared to have great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world.
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0036.wav|3|and, apparently seriously, as a political prophet -- a man who said that after 20 years he would be prime minister.

e_woman1/train/LJ040-0076.wav|3|In the fall of that year John Pic and Robert Oswald went to a military academy
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0086.wav|3|In the fall of 1948 she told John Pic and Robert Oswald
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0096.wav|3|Pic said, quote,
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0106.wav|3|It also appears that Lee tried to tag along with his older brothers
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0116.wav|3|who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother, having struck her on at least one occasion.
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0126.wav|3|Oswald was remanded for psychiatric observation to Youth House, an institution in which children are kept for psychiatric observation
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0136.wav|3|There are children in here who have killed people, and smoke. I want to get out, end quote,
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0146.wav|3|He noted that Lee liked to give the impression that he did not care for other people but preferred to keep to himself,
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0156.wav|3|No finding of neurological impairment or psychotic mental changes could be made.
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0166.wav|3|She also noted that there was, quote, a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved, affectionless youngster
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0176.wav|3|He admitted to fantasies about being powerful and sometimes hurting and killing people, but refused to elaborate on them.
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0186.wav|3|Lee scored an IQ of 118 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0196.wav|3|into which he appeared to be retreating.

e_woman1/train/LJ040-0216.wav|3|In view of his experiences when he visited his relatives in New Orleans in the spring of 1950, and his other solitary habits,
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0226.wav|3|I couldn't in all honesty sincerely say such a thing.
e_woman1/train/LJ040-0236.wav|3|and when his mother failed to cooperate in any way with school authorities,
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0006.wav|3|His mother exercised little control over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go on in school.
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0016.wav|3|Voebel took Oswald back to the school to attend to his wounds, and their, quote, mild friendship, end quote, stemmed from that incident.
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0026.wav|3|from which Oswald appeared to suffer.
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0036.wav|3|He was a little dismayed at this, and he said that he couldn't find any that would show any interest in him as a Communist,
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0046.wav|3|There is evidence that Oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join the Marines by the fact that his brother Robert had done so
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0056.wav|3|in his intense desire to join the Marines and get away from his surroundings and his mother.
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0066.wav|3|his general personality would alienate the group against him, end quote.
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0076.wav|3|and put them in positions of prominence, end quote. Oswald manifested this feeling about authority by baiting his officers.
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0086.wav|3|and then used the, quote, special treatment, end quote, he received as an example of the way in which he was being picked on and, quote,
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0096.wav|3|Normally, it would be a good type of literature; and the one that I recall was "Leaves of Grass," by Walt Whitman, end quote.
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0106.wav|3|At the court-martial hearing which followed, Oswald admitted that he had been rather drunk when the incident occurred.
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0116.wav|3|after it was learned that he had defected to the Soviet Union.
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0126.wav|3|But while we were in Russia he spoke well of him. Lee said that when he would return to the United States he would vote for him for Governor, end quote.

e_woman1/train/LJ041-0166.wav|3|in honor of some retiring noncommissioned officers, an event which they both approached with little enthusiasm.
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0176.wav|3|He recalled that Oswald had a specific interest in Latin America, particularly Cuba,
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0186.wav|3|as some kind of tribunal,
e_woman1/train/LJ041-0196.wav|3|even though as his wife suggested, that interest may have been motivated by a desire to gain attention. He used his Marxist and associated activities

e_woman1/train/LJ042-0134.wav|3|The psychological effects of that change must have been highly unsettling. It should be remembered
e_woman1/train/LJ042-0144.wav|3|After the assassination she wrote that, quote,

e_woman1/train/LJ044-0147.wav|3|and in late June or early July he told his wife that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union with her. She said that he was extremely upset,

e_woman1/train/LJ045-0059.wav|3|The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.

e_woman1/train/LJ045-0199.wav|3|Whether he thought about assassinating the President over the weekend can never be known, but it is reasonably certain
e_woman1/train/LJ045-0209.wav|3|but it was also, at least in part, because his wife did not want to live there with him.
e_woman1/train/LJ045-0219.wav|3|that he wanted to make peace with her and bring his family to Dallas where they could live with him again.
e_woman1/train/LJ045-0229.wav|3|He then killed Patrolman Tippit when that police officer apparently tried to question him after he had left his roominghouse and he vigorously resisted arrest

e_woman1/train/LJ046-0219.wav|3|The above action should be taken without delay in order to attempt to verify the information and no evaluation of the information should be attempted.

e_woman1/train/LJ047-0025.wav|3|During the next 2 years the FBI continued to accumulate information,
e_woman1/train/LJ047-0035.wav|3|Oswald's file at the Department of State Passport Office was reviewed in June 1962.
e_woman1/train/LJ047-0045.wav|3|and promised to advise the FBI if he heard from them.
e_woman1/train/LJ047-0055.wav|3|It does not preclude the agent in charge of the case from reopening it if he feels that further work should be done.
e_woman1/train/LJ047-0065.wav|3|This information led Hosty to review Oswald's file, from which he learned that Oswald had become a subscriber to the Worker,
e_woman1/train/LJ047-0075.wav|3|Hosty had inquired earlier and found no evidence that it was functioning in the Dallas area.
e_woman1/train/LJ047-0085.wav|3|The FBI had not asked to be informed of any effort by Oswald to obtain a passport,
e_woman1/train/LJ047-0095.wav|3|On the next day, he asked the New Orleans police to arrange for him to be interviewed by the FBI.
e_woman1/train/LJ047-0105.wav|3|In Quigley's judgment,
e_woman1/train/LJ047-0115.wav|3|Several days later, the Bureau received additional evidence that Oswald had lied to Agent Quigley.

e_woman1/train/LJ048-0105.wav|3|but these routes would not have been in accordance with the White House staff instructions given the Secret Service for a desirable motorcade route.
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0116.wav|3|Agent Lawson was not given written instructions concerning the Dallas trip or advice about any peculiar problems which it might involve;
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0126.wav|3|Special Agent in Charge Sorrels testified that the advance preparations followed on this occasion were, quote, pretty much the same, end quote,
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0136.wav|3|In the description of the important aspects of the advance preparations,
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0146.wav|3|Discussions with the Dallas authorities and requests made of them were entirely informal.
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0156.wav|3|and suggested the desirability of such a statement.
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0166.wav|3|But on out-of-town trips where the route is decided on and made public only a few days in advance,
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0176.wav|3|Even if it were possible with a vastly larger force of security officers to do so, many observers have felt
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0186.wav|3|Instead of such advance precautions, the Secret Service depended in part on the efforts of local law enforcement personnel stationed along the route.
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0196.wav|3|According to Captain Lawrence, quote,
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0206.wav|3|As the motorcade approached Elm Street

e_woman1/train/LJ048-0226.wav|3|All of the agents stayed for a drink of beer, or in several cases, a mixed drink.
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0236.wav|3|There is no indication that any of the agents who visited the Cellar Coffee House had any intoxicating drink at that establishment.

e_woman1/train/LJ048-0266.wav|3|and special agents cooperating with them on Presidential and similar protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for official duty
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0276.wav|3|Since he was convinced that this was not the case, he believed that it would be unfair to the agents and their families to take explicit disciplinary measures.
e_woman1/train/LJ048-0286.wav|3|Nor is this goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours, and lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep.

e_woman1/train/LJ050-0078.wav|3|In June 1964, the Secret Service sent to a number of Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies

e_woman1/train/LJ050-0178.wav|3|to make certain that all protective intelligence activities are coordinated.

e_woman1/train/LJ050-0218.wav|3|Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
e_woman1/train/LJ050-0228.wav|3|The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,
e_woman1/train/LJ050-0238.wav|3|which represents a departure from its prior practice.
e_woman1/train/LJ050-0248.wav|3|and the Secret Service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.
e_woman1/train/LJ050-0258.wav|3|Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment,
e_woman1/train/LJ050-0268.wav|3|The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.
e_woman1/train/LJ050-0278.wav|3|the recommendations we have here suggested would greatly advance the security of the office without any impairment of our fundamental liberties.

e_man2/train/LJ001-0030.wav|4|a very few years saw the birth of Roman character not only in Italy, but in Germany and France.
e_man2/train/LJ001-0040.wav|4|and is very simple and legible, and unaffectedly designed for use; but it is by no means without beauty.
e_man2/train/LJ001-0050.wav|4|and though the famous family of Aldus restored its technical excellence, rejecting battered letters,
e_man2/train/LJ001-0060.wav|4|It must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries

e_man2/train/LJ001-0080.wav|4|he seems to have taken the letter of the Elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model:
e_man2/train/LJ001-0090.wav|4|With this change the art of printing touched bottom,
e_man2/train/LJ001-0100.wav|4|and these somewhat wiry letters are suitable for the machine process, which would not do justice to letters of more generous design.
e_man2/train/LJ001-0110.wav|4|Even the Caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect:
e_man2/train/LJ001-0120.wav|4|In the old print each figure has its definite individuality, and one cannot be mistaken for the other;
e_man2/train/LJ001-0130.wav|4|Commercialism again compels the use of type too small in size to be comfortable reading:

e_man2/train/LJ001-0150.wav|4|the page so lay on the paper that there was more space allowed to the bottom and fore margin than to the top and back of the paper,
e_man2/train/LJ001-0160.wav|4|by that made in America, which is the worst conceivable.
e_man2/train/LJ001-0170.wav|4|being thin, tough, and opaque.
e_man2/train/LJ001-0180.wav|4|the proportions of the page still give pleasure by the sense of richness that the cuts and letter together convey.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0004.wav|4|The new jail fell as far short of the demands made on it as did the old.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0014.wav|4|The numbers soon increased, however, and by 1811 had again risen to 629; and Mr. Neild was told that there had been at one time

e_man2/train/LJ002-0074.wav|4|and tells us that in the state side, quote, such prisoners were safely associated whose manners and conduct evince a more liberal style of education,
e_man2/train/LJ002-0084.wav|4|those on the first floor were rather larger on account of a set-off in the wall; and the uppermost were the largest, for the same reason.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0094.wav|4|with four casements and two fireplaces, being allotted for a female infirmary
e_man2/train/LJ002-0104.wav|4|can be permitted to enter the interior of this prison. End quote. The tap-room and bar were just behind the felons' entrance lodge,
e_man2/train/LJ002-0114.wav|4|and imprisonment for debt has almost entirely disappeared.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0125.wav|4|Neild also says that in 1793,
e_man2/train/LJ002-0135.wav|4|but as time passed, difficulties and delays in obtaining judgment led to the removal of causes to the great Court of King's Bench,
e_man2/train/LJ002-0145.wav|4|Often a commissioner had to leave the bench because he was himself a party to the suit that was sub judice.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0155.wav|4|for which the costs were 6 shillings 10 pence.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0165.wav|4|Bird was, however, discharged within three days by a subscription raised among his fellow-prisoners.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0175.wav|4|The costs in heavier debts always doubled the sum; if the arrest was made in the country it trebled it.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0185.wav|4|The King's Bench was a national prison, in which were confined all debtors arrested for debt or for contempt of the court of the King's Bench.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0195.wav|4|Besides these, a number had the privilege of a "run on the key," which allowed a prisoner to go into the rules for the day.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0205.wav|4|A man dying of liver complaint lay on the cold stones without a bed or food to eat.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0215.wav|4|It was so used for the date of the abolition of the Star Chamber in the 16th Charles I.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0225.wav|4|The rentals of rooms and fees went to the warden, whose income was £2372.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0235.wav|4|were places set apart for skittles, fives, and tennis, which strangers frequented as any other place of public amusement.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0245.wav|4|The prison was a nest of abuses, like its neighbor the King's Bench
e_man2/train/LJ002-0255.wav|4|A court of the collegians was held every Monday to manage its affairs, at which all prisoners were required to attend.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0265.wav|4|left by a Mr. Henry Allnutt, who was long a prisoner in the Marshalsea, and came into a fortune while there.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0275.wav|4|At one time the Ludgate debtors, accompanied by the keeper,

e_man2/train/LJ002-0295.wav|4|This was the reprehensible claim for "garnish," which had already been abolished in all well-conducted prisons, but which still was demanded in Newgate.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0305.wav|4|and thus when the debtor's debt had been actually paid, or when he had abandoned his property to the creditors, and, almost destitute,
e_man2/train/LJ002-0315.wav|4|But this weekly pittance did not go far when the debtors' side was crowded, as it often was;
e_man2/train/LJ002-0325.wav|4|or the sixpenny allowance was claimed for the creditors, which seldom happened, owing to the expense the process entailed.
e_man2/train/LJ002-0335.wav|4|so were candles, salt, pepper, mops and brooms. But the latter could have been of little service. Dirt prevailed everywhere;
e_man2/train/LJ003-0007.wav|4|hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there, and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtors' side.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0017.wav|4|Order throughout the debtors' side was preserved

e_man2/train/LJ003-0047.wav|4|Newgate continued to be a reproach to those responsible for its management.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0057.wav|4|A further sub-classification was attempted by separating at night those charged with misdemeanors from those charged with felony,
e_man2/train/LJ003-0067.wav|4|in the then existing state of the law,
e_man2/train/LJ003-0077.wav|4|Two of the untried were for murder, and several for house-breaking and highway robbery.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0087.wav|4|These often remained in Newgate for six months, sometimes a year, in some cases longer;
e_man2/train/LJ003-0097.wav|4|with convicts of all ages and characters, to render it next to impossible but that, with the obliteration of all sense of self-respect,
e_man2/train/LJ003-0107.wav|4|he slept in the same bed with a highwayman on one side, and a man charged with murder on the other.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0117.wav|4|A bribe to the judge was certain to secure acquittal, and the neglect of the formality was as certainly followed by condemnation.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0127.wav|4|Quote, by insensible degrees he began to lose his repugnance to their society,
e_man2/train/LJ003-0137.wav|4|and I learned he had been up with the others the whole night.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0147.wav|4|Besides the jail fees, there was garnish of half-a-guinea, collected by the steward,
e_man2/train/LJ003-0157.wav|4|The best accommodation the jail could offer was reserved for the prisoners on the state side,
e_man2/train/LJ003-0167.wav|4|The fee for admission to the state side, as fixed by the table of fees, was three guineas, but Mr. Newman declared that he never took more than two.

e_man2/train/LJ003-0187.wav|4|I have kept till the last that part of the prison which was usually the last resting-place of so many.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0197.wav|4|This procrastination bred certain callousness.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0207.wav|4|For while Roman Catholics and Dissenters were encouraged to see ministers of their own persuasion,
e_man2/train/LJ003-0217.wav|4|The condemned occupied an open pew in the center of the chapel, hung with black; in front of them, upon a table, was a black coffin in full view.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0227.wav|4|So unjust and unequal was the system, that the allowance to convicted criminals was better than that of the innocent debtor,
e_man2/train/LJ003-0237.wav|4|The fees on reception and discharge must be deemed exorbitant, when it is remembered the impoverished class who usually crowded the jail;
e_man2/train/LJ003-0247.wav|4|or the faithful discharge of some petty office, such as gatesman or captain of a ward.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0257.wav|4|Searches were made certainly, but they were too often superficial, or they might be evaded by a trifling bribe.

e_man2/train/LJ003-0278.wav|4|Insuperable difficulties were still supposed to stand in the way of any general employment of prisoners at their trades.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0288.wav|4|The above-mentioned report was ordered to be printed upon the 9th May.

e_man2/train/LJ003-0308.wav|4|A laundry should be established, and a matron appointed on the female side, where all the prisoners' washing could be performed.
e_man2/train/LJ003-0318.wav|4|No prisoners should in future be ironed, except in cases of misconduct,
e_man2/train/LJ003-0328.wav|4|Had they been accepted in their entirety, little fault could in future have been found with the managers of Newgate.

e_man2/train/LJ004-0029.wav|4|The erection of new prison buildings was made imperative under certain conditions and following certain rules
e_man2/train/LJ004-0039.wav|4|They were hopeless of any general reform by the action of the executive alone.
e_man2/train/LJ004-0049.wav|4|Mr. Gurney, Mr. Fry, Messrs. Forster, and Mr. T. F. Buxton, the coadjutor of Wilberforce in the great anti-slavery struggle.
e_man2/train/LJ004-0060.wav|4|"You have no right," he says, addressing the authorities, "to subject a prisoner to suffering from cold,
e_man2/train/LJ004-0070.wav|4|the conservation of his health and industrious habits, are the clear, evident, undeniable rights of an unconvicted prisoner."
e_man2/train/LJ004-0080.wav|4|because they are not specified in his sentence; he is therefore entitled to a wholesome atmosphere,
e_man2/train/LJ004-0090.wav|4|Again, the 22 Charles II. c 20 ordered the jailer to keep felons and debtors "separate and apart from one another,
e_man2/train/LJ004-0100.wav|4|An infirmary, consisting of two distinct rooms, one for males and one for females, should be provided for the separate accommodation of the sick.
e_man2/train/LJ004-0110.wav|4|It was made incumbent upon the justices to provide distinct places of confinement for five classes of prisoners, viz.
e_man2/train/LJ004-0120.wav|4|In 1818, out of five hundred and eighteen prisons in the United Kingdom,

e_man2/train/LJ004-0190.wav|4|There were eighty-four separate sleeping-cells, and unless the jail was overcrowded, every inmate passed the night alone,
e_man2/train/LJ004-0200.wav|4|Another jail, that of Ilchester, was also worthy of all commendation. It exhibited all the good points of that at Bury.
e_man2/train/LJ004-0210.wav|4|There was a prison laundry too, where all the prisoners' linen was regularly washed.
e_man2/train/LJ004-0220.wav|4|for breakfast a pint of gruel; for dinner half a pound of boiled meat, or a quart of soup with vegetables, on alternate days.
e_man2/train/LJ004-0230.wav|4|It was found that shackles might be safely dispensed with, even in the case of the most desperate characters.
e_man2/train/LJ004-0240.wav|4|He left Newgate utterly corrupted, and after lapsing into crime, soon returned with a very different character.

e_man2/train/LJ005-0050.wav|4|and in moral and religious duty, and which after a time sought to provide them with suitable situations, was supported entirely out of the funds of the Society.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0060.wav|4|The Society did not limit its remarks to the description of what had already been done

e_man2/train/LJ005-0101.wav|4|whence it deduced the practice and condition of every prison that replied.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0111.wav|4|In a county prison adjoining the metropolis, the separation between the male and female quarters was supposed to be accomplished by the erection of an iron railing;
e_man2/train/LJ005-0121.wav|4|By degrees, however,
e_man2/train/LJ005-0131.wav|4|In many places too where the prisoners earned money by their work, they were granted a portion of it for their own use after proper deduction for maintenance.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0141.wav|4|the sleeping space per head was only sixteen inches, and often as many as 293 men had to be accommodated on barrack beds
e_man2/train/LJ005-0151.wav|4|in others women were very properly exempted from it, and also from all severe labor.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0161.wav|4|too much discretion was still left to the magistracy to fill in the details. The legislature only recommended,
e_man2/train/LJ005-0171.wav|4|we shall find but few which have not in one or other of these ways removed the grievance of which such just complaint is made.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0181.wav|4|The right and privilege of the borough to maintain its own place of confinement was so "ancient and indisputable,"
e_man2/train/LJ005-0191.wav|4|The Society proceeded to support this indictment by facts. It is much the old story.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0201.wav|4|as is shown by the report of the Commissioners to inquire into the state of the municipal corporations in 1835.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0211.wav|4|the jail consisted of six cells, frequently so damp that the moisture trickled down the walls; there was not space for air or exercise,
e_man2/train/LJ005-0221.wav|4|and the panes were filled in with oiled paper, an insufficient protection against the weather;
e_man2/train/LJ005-0231.wav|4|The city justices had not fulfilled this obligation.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0241.wav|4|till the whole body of the slaves were manumitted in 1833.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0251.wav|4|Again in 1835 prisons and their inmates became once more the care of the senate, and the subject was taken up this time by the House of Lords.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0261.wav|4|As a means of securing this uniformity,
e_man2/train/LJ005-0271.wav|4|As a means of increasing the severity of imprisonment, letters and visits from outside should not be permitted during the first six months of an imprisonment.
e_man2/train/LJ005-0281.wav|4|that the greatest mischief followed from the intercourse which was still permitted in so many prisons; to use its words,
e_man2/train/LJ005-0291.wav|4|In some large towns, as at Berwick on Tweed, Southampton, and Southwark, they (the prisons) are in a very discreditable condition.

e_man2/train/LJ006-0031.wav|4|that punishment must be reformatory as well as deterrent.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0042.wav|4|Relapse was rapid and inevitable, so that the latter state of the prison was worse than the first.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0052.wav|4|The sum total thus produced was inconsiderable compared with the hundreds that had formerly filled the jail,
e_man2/train/LJ006-0062.wav|4|In another part there were men charged with and convicted of unnatural offenses shut up with lads of tender years;
e_man2/train/LJ006-0072.wav|4|I shall have occasion to speak again, and more at length, of Mr. Cope's careless and perfunctory discharge
e_man2/train/LJ006-0082.wav|4|and this particular official took excellent care to select as residents for his own ward those most suitable from his own point of view.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0092.wav|4|and under the scanty covering of a couple of dirty stable-rugs apiece.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0102.wav|4|This, too, was in the depth of the winter, and during a most inclement season.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0112.wav|4|he might keep him from the fire, or give him his soup or gruel in a pail instead of a basin.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0122.wav|4|and by these payments a wardsman had been known to amass as much as £40.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0132.wav|4|All the wardsmen alike were more or less irresponsible.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0142.wav|4|The matron deposed to having seen the gates-woman "exceedingly drunk," and having been insulted by her.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0152.wav|4|One turnkey had been so employed several hours daily for nearly eleven years.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0162.wav|4|But it is only fair to Mr. Cope to state that he himself said he went whenever he could find time
e_man2/train/LJ006-0172.wav|4|and evils that should have been speedily rooted out remained because they had the prescription of long usage.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0182.wav|4|Under the reckless contempt for regulations,
e_man2/train/LJ006-0192.wav|4|There was no school for adults; only the boys were taught anything, and their instructor, with his assistant, were convicted prisoners.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0202.wav|4|The news-vendor was also a tobacconist,
e_man2/train/LJ006-0212.wav|4|brought in beer for sale from a neighboring public-house, and visited all the wards with no other escort than the prisoner gatesman.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0222.wav|4|and enlivened by flash songs and thrilling long-winded descriptions of robberies and other "plants."
e_man2/train/LJ006-0232.wav|4|More often they occurred at night, and were continued to the bitter end.
e_man2/train/LJ006-0242.wav|4|Watkins' case, referred to above, is made the subject of another and a special report from the surgeon.

e_man2/train/LJ010-0089.wav|4|While a few secured the servants, the rest were to fall upon Lord Harrowby and his guests.
e_man2/train/LJ010-0099.wav|4|The conspirators were in a loft, approached by a ladder and a trap-door, access through which could only be obtained one by one.
e_man2/train/LJ010-0109.wav|4|Thistlewood made a long and rambling defense, the chief features of which were abuse of Lord Sidmouth, and the vilification of the informer Edwards.
e_man2/train/LJ010-0119.wav|4|It was asserted, not without foundation, at these trials, that Edwards repeatedly incited the associates he was betraying
e_man2/train/LJ010-0129.wav|4|but Ings said he hoped God would be more merciful to him than men had been.
e_man2/train/LJ010-0139.wav|4|After the five bodies had hung for half-an-hour, a man in a mask came forward to complete the sentence.

e_man2/train/LJ010-0249.wav|4|There was some doubt as to whether the pistol when fired was actually loaded with ball, but the jury brought in a verdict of guilty

e_man2/train/LJ013-0033.wav|4|The Wallaces were arrested, committed to Newgate, and tried at the Old Bailey.
e_man2/train/LJ013-0043.wav|4|This person made much of Wallace, encouraged his attentions to his daughter,
e_man2/train/LJ013-0053.wav|4|Miss Bailey, the doctor's sister, in whose favor the note was said to have been given,

e_man2/train/LJ013-0103.wav|4|At Halifax Forrester learnt that the men he wanted had gone on to Boston, thence to Buffalo and Canada, and back to Boston.
e_man2/train/LJ013-0113.wav|4|Robberies as daring in conception as they were boldly executed were common enough.
e_man2/train/LJ013-0123.wav|4|The club spoons and other articles of plate were long a source of profitable income to a gentleman named Ashley,
e_man2/train/LJ013-0133.wav|4|a number of pawnbrokers' duplicates, and three small files. It was proved at the trial that Ashley had asked his landlady for brick-dust and leather,
e_man2/train/LJ013-0143.wav|4|These packages were consigned to Messrs. Shroeder of London; and as it was known that they were to arrive in Ker's ship,
e_man2/train/LJ013-0153.wav|4|The gravest crimes continued at intervals to inspire the town with horror, and concentrate public attention upon the jail of Newgate,
e_man2/train/LJ013-0163.wav|4|The housemaid summoned the cook, and both went to call the valet, Courvoisier,
e_man2/train/LJ013-0173.wav|4|The researches of the police soon laid bare other suspicious facts.
e_man2/train/LJ013-0183.wav|4|The valet's strange demeanor had attracted attention from the first.
e_man2/train/LJ013-0193.wav|4|Courvoisier, when put on his trial, pleaded not guilty;
e_man2/train/LJ013-0203.wav|4|On his removal to Newgate after sentence,
e_man2/train/LJ013-0213.wav|4|This seems to have decided Courvoisier,
e_man2/train/LJ013-0223.wav|4|Courvoisier wished to commit suicide in Newgate, but was prevented by the vigilant supervision to which he was subjected while in jail.
e_man2/train/LJ013-0233.wav|4|The bed was searched, but no piece of sharpened wood was found. It was thought that it might have been lost in changing the mattresses.
e_man2/train/LJ013-0243.wav|4|Good now offered to go to Wandsworth and satisfy the pawnbroker.
e_man2/train/LJ013-0253.wav|4|with a son of Good's by a former wife. Another wife, real or fictitious, existed in Spitalfields,

e_man2/train/LJ014-0095.wav|4|On the third day his friends began to inquire for him,
e_man2/train/LJ014-0105.wav|4|He was lying on his face, his legs tied up to his hips so as to allow of the body fitting into the hole.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0115.wav|4|and they had given information to the police.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0125.wav|4|Mrs. Manning was not without personal charms;
e_man2/train/LJ014-0135.wav|4|It was against common sense to charge her with murdering the only friend she had in the world;
e_man2/train/LJ014-0146.wav|4|They had to handcuff her by force against the most violent resistance, and still she raged and stormed,
e_man2/train/LJ014-0156.wav|4|and through all ate heartily at every meal, slept soundly at nights, and talked with cheerfulness on almost any subject.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0166.wav|4|faded in my mind before the atrocious bearing, looks, and language of the assembled spectators.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0176.wav|4|His determined addiction to evil courses had led to his being cast off by his family,
e_man2/train/LJ014-0186.wav|4|A milliner's porter,
e_man2/train/LJ014-0196.wav|4|by his identification by Cope in Westminster Hospital, who survived long enough to make a formal deposition before Mr. Jardine,
e_man2/train/LJ014-0206.wav|4|His captors, it may be added (Lerigo and Allen), were warmly commended by the judge for their courage and activity.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0216.wav|4|and by getting his hand inside Dwyer's stock, with the idea of strangling him.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0226.wav|4|Only a few have vied with Cannon in fiendish cruelty and brutality.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0236.wav|4|Barthelemy was generally supposed to have been a secret agent of the French police.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0246.wav|4|Thus, when a payment was made by the company, the amount disbursed was carried to account in the general books from its entry in the passbook,
e_man2/train/LJ014-0256.wav|4|It seems incredible that this passbook, which when produced in court
e_man2/train/LJ014-0266.wav|4|No one cared too closely to inquire into the sources of wealth. Some said he was a fortunate speculator in stocks,
e_man2/train/LJ014-0277.wav|4|An inquiry was at once set on foot, and the frauds were traced to Watts.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0288.wav|4|That same evening he committed suicide in Newgate.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0298.wav|4|Strange to say, a second suicide occurred in Newgate the same night,
e_man2/train/LJ014-0308.wav|4|others, that Napoleon III., but recently proclaimed Emperor of the French, wished to gain the popularity necessary to secure the people.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0318.wav|4|Another set of frauds, which resembled those of Pries in principle, although not in practice, were soon afterwards discovered.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0329.wav|4|and so developed his business that in one year his transactions amounted to a couple of millions of pounds.
e_man2/train/LJ014-0339.wav|4|asked Davidson and Gordon, a firm with which Cole was closely allied, whether the warrants meant goods or nothing.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0009.wav|4|Cole's difficulties increased more and more; warrant-holders came down upon him demanding to realize their goods.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0019.wav|4|The Strahan of the firm which came to grief was a Snow who changed his name for a fortune of £200,000;
e_man2/train/LJ015-0029.wav|4|In December 1851 the balance sheet showed a deficiency of upwards of £70,000.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0039.wav|4|Money they must have, and money they raised to meet their urgent necessities upon the balances and securities deposited with them by their customers.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0049.wav|4|They admitted that they had made away with many of the securities entrusted to their keeping.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0059.wav|4|Two cases of extensive embezzlement which were discovered almost simultaneously, those of Robson and Redpath,
e_man2/train/LJ015-0069.wav|4|but the firm he served got him a situation as clerk in the office of the Great Northern Railway,

e_man2/train/LJ015-0099.wav|4|"Let us go to Kilburn for them together," said Mr. Fasson, growing suspicious.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0109.wav|4|and he discussed the latter with appetite, but begged that they would never give him curry again, as he did not like it.

e_man2/train/LJ015-0139.wav|4|an open-handed, unthinking charity which gave freely to the poor and needy the money which belonged to his creditors.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0149.wav|4|peas at ten shillings a quart, five-guinea pines, and early asparagus were to be found on his table.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0159.wav|4|In his person he was neat and fastidious;
e_man2/train/LJ015-0169.wav|4|It was at once decided at the board to make a thorough examination of all his books.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0179.wav|4|The Central Criminal Court, when the trial came on,
e_man2/train/LJ015-0189.wav|4|and the prototype of a class not uncommon in our later days
e_man2/train/LJ015-0199.wav|4|The improved methods of locomotion had put a stop to these depredations. People traveled in company, as a rule;
e_man2/train/LJ015-0209.wav|4|Burgess detailed the whole system of transmission.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0219.wav|4|At last he decided to enlist one Tester, a clerk in the traffic department, whom he thought would prove a likely tool.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0229.wav|4|who quickly took the wax impression, handed it back to Pierce; Pierce replaced it, left the office, and the thing was done.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0239.wav|4|Just as the train was starting Agar slipped into the van with Burgess, and Pierce got into a first-class carriage.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0249.wav|4|The theft was discovered at Boulogne, when the boxes were found not to weigh exactly what they ought. But no clue was obtained to the thieves,
e_man2/train/LJ015-0259.wav|4|Agar too, in Newgate, heard how Pierce had treated him, and at once readily turned approver.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0269.wav|4|He was known to the whole criminal fraternity as a high-class receiver of stolen goods, a negotiator more especially of stolen paper,
e_man2/train/LJ015-0279.wav|4|One stroke of luck which he turned to great account
e_man2/train/LJ015-0289.wav|4|As each transaction was carried out from a different address, and a different messenger always employed,
e_man2/train/LJ015-0299.wav|4|and the circumstances were deemed sufficiently suspicious to warrant the arrest of the gentlemen at Yarmouth on a charge of forgery and conspiracy.
e_man2/train/LJ015-0309.wav|4|and the judge, in passing sentence on him of transportation for life, expressed deep regret that "the ingenuity, skill, and talent,
e_man2/train/LJ016-0005.wav|4|Year after year prisoners determined to get free, and occasionally succeeded in their efforts.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0015.wav|4|White, when taxed with his attempt, admitted that the accusation was true, and spoke "with pride and satisfaction of the practicability of his scheme."
e_man2/train/LJ016-0025.wav|4|who, while detained in the press-yard as a capital convict, under sentence of death for burglary,

e_man2/train/LJ016-0045.wav|4|and at length reached a point opposite the top of the building containing the condemned wards. This had been a perilous and painful task;
e_man2/train/LJ016-0055.wav|4|He traversed vainly all the roofs in Newgate Street,
e_man2/train/LJ016-0065.wav|4|To walk out into the street was an easy affair, and he was now free, with one and fourpence in his pocket and a shirt and trousers for all his clothing.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0075.wav|4|It was for some time after this a constant practice to go up the chimneys in the hopes of escaping by the flue.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0086.wav|4|were fixed over the fireplaces, and the prisoners had no longer access to the chimneys.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0096.wav|4|They were penal servitude men, their names Bell, Brown, and Barry, and they were awaiting transfer to Leicester,
e_man2/train/LJ016-0106.wav|4|with a civil note to the governor, saying he had no further use for them. All three fugitives were recaptured,
e_man2/train/LJ016-0116.wav|4|The doors, through incomplete knowledge of prison needs, were not, as now, sheeted with iron.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0126.wav|4|The top of the wall was gained without difficulty.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0136.wav|4|On the other hand, at the great convict establishments, such is the moral restraint of a systematic discipline,

e_man2/train/LJ016-0166.wav|4|and surgical opinion stated that the stoppage of circulation was the cause of death.

e_man2/train/LJ016-0196.wav|4|He accepted, having at first Tom Cheshire as his assistant, then for a time, when Cheshire was dismissed for drunkenness, a man named Osborne.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0206.wav|4|he was also at liberty to engage himself in the country, where he demanded and was paid £10 on each occasion.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0216.wav|4|That very ancient perquisite the convict's clothes was never claimed by Calcraft, and it may be doubted whether he was entitled to it.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0226.wav|4|To this curious etiquette was due the appointment of an official whose office has long since disappeared, "the yeoman of the halter,"
e_man2/train/LJ016-0236.wav|4|Marwood being, on the other hand, in favor of giving a man as much rope as possible.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0246.wav|4|Over the door, in gilt letters, were the words "Crown Office"; in the window was a pile of official envelopes, ostentatiously displayed,

e_man2/train/LJ016-0266.wav|4|No notion that they were assisting at a vindication of the law filled the minds of those present with dread.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0278.wav|4|and which contributed in no small degree to the introduction of private executions. A great crowd was expected, and a great crowd came.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0288.wav|4|"Müller, Müller, He's the man," till a diversion was created by the appearance of the gallows, which was received with continuous yells.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0298.wav|4|But before "the slight slow vibrations of the body had well ended,
e_man2/train/LJ016-0308.wav|4|yet the witnesses were not unanimous.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0318.wav|4|Other officials, great lawyers, governors of prisons, and chaplains supported this view.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0328.wav|4|Nevertheless, in the very next session
e_man2/train/LJ016-0338.wav|4|inside the jail was Colonel Frazer, the chief commissioner of the city police, and at no great distance, although in the background,
e_man2/train/LJ016-0349.wav|4|that of Alexander Mackay, who murdered his mistress at Norton Folgate by beating her with a rolling-pin and furnace-rake,
e_man2/train/LJ016-0359.wav|4|Private executions at their first introduction were not popular with the Newgate officials, and for intelligible reasons.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0369.wav|4|upon them devolved the painful duty of cutting down the body and preparing for the inquest.
e_man2/train/LJ016-0380.wav|4|with hope to the last. There is always the chance of a flaw in the indictment, of a missing witness, or extenuating circumstances.

e_man2/train/LJ017-0025.wav|4|the justice of the sentence was doubted at the time.
e_man2/train/LJ017-0035.wav|4|in the interests and for the due protection of the public, that the fullest and fairest inquiry should be made,
e_man2/train/LJ017-0045.wav|4|The Central Criminal Court was crowded to suffocation.
e_man2/train/LJ017-0055.wav|4|Throughout his trial he preserved an impassive countenance, but he clearly took a deep interest in all that passed.
e_man2/train/LJ017-0065.wav|4|I ought also to confess the others: I mean my wife and my brother's. End quote.
e_man2/train/LJ017-0075.wav|4|There is every reason to suppose that he poisoned his wife to obtain possession of this sum upon her death.
e_man2/train/LJ017-0085.wav|4|Palmer's plan was to administer poison in quantities insufficient to cause death, but enough to produce illness which would account for death.
e_man2/train/LJ017-0095.wav|4|The purchase by Palmer of strychnia was proved.
e_man2/train/LJ017-0105.wav|4|Cook's death was horrible
e_man2/train/LJ017-0115.wav|4|but it was proved that Palmer tried hard to get possession of the jar containing them,
e_man2/train/LJ017-0125.wav|4|He never actually said that he was not guilty, but he was confident he would not be convicted.
e_man2/train/LJ017-0135.wav|4|Dove, a fiendish brute, found from the evidence in that case that he could kill his wife, whom he hated,

e_man2/train/LJ017-0175.wav|4|The circumstances were strange. Mrs. Wilson had gone to the chemist's for medicine,
e_man2/train/LJ017-0185.wav|4|She was in good health on leaving home, and had with her a large sum of money.

e_man2/train/LJ017-0225.wav|4|The latter had the watch on deck.
e_man2/train/LJ017-0235.wav|4|He was soon summoned on deck, but as he would not move, the mutineers came down and stood in a circle round his berth.
e_man2/train/LJ017-0245.wav|4|On the 2nd October they sighted land, ten miles distant;
e_man2/train/LJ017-0255.wav|4|repaired there secretly, and so gave information to the Brazilian authorities.

e_man2/train/LJ017-0276.wav|4|Then he wanted to know when the policemen would arrive, and was told none would come.
e_man2/train/LJ018-0003.wav|4|As the circumstances under which it was perpetrated were somewhat novel,

e_man2/train/LJ019-0045.wav|4|Not less remarkable than this diverse interpretation of a manifest duty

e_man2/train/LJ019-0125.wav|4|But an open farm of a thousand acres would have offered abundant chances of escape, which some at least would have attempted, probably with success.

e_man2/train/LJ019-0145.wav|4|But reformation was only skin deep. Below the surface many of the old evils still rankled.
e_man2/train/LJ019-0155.wav|4|The enforcement of discipline depended upon the want of honor among thieves.

e_man2/train/LJ019-0245.wav|4|The inquiry was most searching and complete, and the committee spoke plainly in its report.

e_man2/train/LJ024-0055.wav|4|We think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary

e_man2/train/LJ025-0052.wav|4|the greatest and most rapid revolution which biological science has ever undergone was effected by the application of the modern microscope
e_man2/train/LJ025-0062.wav|4|under particular circumstances, the contents of the cells of certain water-weeds were set free and moved about with considerable velocity
e_man2/train/LJ025-0072.wav|4|Hence the teleological argument for Cuvier's first diagnostic character
e_man2/train/LJ025-0082.wav|4|But although Cuvier's leading diagnosis of the animal from the plant will not stand a strict test,
e_man2/train/LJ025-0092.wav|4|It is now established that nitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter
e_man2/train/LJ025-0102.wav|4|yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy
e_man2/train/LJ025-0112.wav|4|With a qualification, to be considered presently, the answer to this question is undoubtedly in the affirmative.
e_man2/train/LJ025-0122.wav|4|The contractility which is the fundamental condition of locomotion," continues Huxley,
e_man2/train/LJ025-0132.wav|4|just as the body of a snail contracts into its shell when one of its "horns" is irritated.

e_man2/train/LJ025-0152.wav|4|So that I know not where we can hope to find any absolute distinction between animals and plants, unless we return to their mode of nutrition
e_man2/train/LJ025-0162.wav|4|will be vastly greater than the weight of the same substances contained in the bean from which it sprang.
e_man2/train/LJ025-0172.wav|4|In fact, the bean obtains two of the absolutely indispensable elements of its substance from two distinct sources.
e_man2/train/LJ026-0006.wav|4|for the manufacture of starchy food from gaseous matter.
e_man2/train/LJ026-0016.wav|4|They ingest solid proteinaceous food,
e_man2/train/LJ026-0026.wav|4|As in the liquefaction of gases, there is a "critical point" at which the substance under experiment is neither gaseous nor liquid.
e_man2/train/LJ026-0036.wav|4|and then a balance must be struck and the doubtful form placed in the kingdom with which it has, on the whole, most points in common.

e_man2/train/LJ026-0056.wav|4|It is, however, impossible for the animal to build these materials directly into the substance of its own body.

e_man2/train/LJ033-0167.wav|4|In addition the tape was compared to determine whether the sample tape and the tape on the bag had been taken from the tape dispensing machine at the Depository.
e_man2/train/LJ033-0177.wav|4|On December 1, 1963, a replica bag was made from materials found on that date in the shipping room.

e_man2/train/LJ034-0033.wav|4|During the afternoon of November 22,

e_man2/train/LJ034-0053.wav|4|reached the same conclusion as Latona that the prints found on the cartons were those of Lee Harvey Oswald.

e_man2/train/LJ034-0113.wav|4|The autopsy report indicated an estimated weight of 150 pounds.
e_man2/train/LJ034-0123.wav|4|Although Brennan testified that the man in the window was standing when he fired the shots, most probably he was either sitting or kneeling.

e_man2/train/LJ034-0184.wav|4|Approximately 1 week after the assassination, according to Fisher, policemen showed him a picture of Oswald.
e_man2/train/LJ034-0194.wav|4|Their testimony is of probative value, however, because their limited description is consistent with that of the man who has been found by the Commission,

e_man2/train/LJ035-0035.wav|4|Because the stairway itself is enclosed, neither Baker nor Truly could see anything on the second-floor hallway until they reached the landing at the top of the stairs.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0045.wav|4|Baker said, quote, He [Truly] had already started around the bend to come to the next elevator going up,
e_man2/train/LJ035-0055.wav|4|Along a side wall of the lunchroom was a soft drink rending machine, but at that time the man had nothing in his hands.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0065.wav|4|Truly also noted at this time that Oswald's hands were empty.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0075.wav|4|A test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom by stairway.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0085.wav|4|from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the stairway to the lunchroom.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0095.wav|4|That Oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom
e_man2/train/LJ035-0105.wav|4|They took the east elevator to the seventh floor and ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several minutes.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0115.wav|4|Oswald's use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other employees in the building.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0125.wav|4|Victoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository Building,
e_man2/train/LJ035-0135.wav|4|ran up and said that the President had been shot.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0145.wav|4|Within a minute after Baker and Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical supervisor for the Texas School Book Depository,
e_man2/train/LJ035-0155.wav|4|The only exit from the office in the direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front stairway.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0165.wav|4|At that time the building had not yet been sealed off by the police.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0175.wav|4|The sergeant did the same thing at the rear of the building.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0185.wav|4|After inspecting this floor, Sawyer returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the building.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0195.wav|4|Satisfying himself that Oswald was missing, Truly obtained Oswald's address, phone number, and description from his employment application card.
e_man2/train/LJ035-0205.wav|4|and no one could be found who saw Oswald anywhere else in the building until after the shooting.
e_man2/train/LJ036-0005.wav|4|He arrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later.
e_man2/train/LJ036-0015.wav|4|According to the reconstruction of time and events which the Commission found most credible,
e_man2/train/LJ036-0025.wav|4|McWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time
e_man2/train/LJ036-0035.wav|4|The man was on the bus approximately 4 minutes.
e_man2/train/LJ036-0045.wav|4|Mrs. Bledsoe told him, quote, I am not going to rent to you any more, end quote,
e_man2/train/LJ036-0055.wav|4|Mrs. Bledsoe identified the shirt as the one Oswald was wearing and she stated she was certain that it was Oswald who boarded the bus.
e_man2/train/LJ036-0065.wav|4|Oswald lived at 1026 North Beckley.
e_man2/train/LJ036-0075.wav|4|walked seven blocks directly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately,
e_man2/train/LJ036-0085.wav|4|Oswald rose from his chair, looked directly at Fritz, and said, quote, Everybody will know who I am now, end quote,
e_man2/train/LJ036-0095.wav|4|but the Commission concluded that this man was not Lee Harvey Oswald,
e_man2/train/LJ036-0105.wav|4|He said, quote,
e_man2/train/LJ036-0115.wav|4|David Knapp, aged 18, was No. 2;
e_man2/train/LJ036-0125.wav|4|and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while at other times he waited to record three or four trips.

e_man2/train/LJ036-0185.wav|4|He hurried to his room and stayed no longer than 3 or 4 minutes.
e_man2/train/LJ036-0195.wav|4|He was described by Chief Curry as having the reputation of being "a very fine, dedicated officer."
e_man2/train/LJ036-0205.wav|4|Tippit must have heard the description of the suspect wanted for the President's shooting; it was broadcast over channel 1 at 12:45 p.m.,
e_man2/train/LJ036-0215.wav|4|He approached the car and apparently exchanged words with Tippit through the right front or vent window.
e_man2/train/LJ037-0007.wav|4|Three others subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph.
e_man2/train/LJ037-0017.wav|4|The man cut across the yard through some bushes, passed within 12 feet of Scoggins, and ran south on Patton.

e_man2/train/LJ037-0047.wav|4|Mrs. Markham then ran to Officer Tippit's side and saw him lying in a pool of blood.
e_man2/train/LJ037-0057.wav|4|He said that Mrs. Markham started crying when Oswald walked into the lineup room.

e_man2/train/LJ037-0087.wav|4|I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When they made him turn sideways, I was positive that was the one I seen, end quote.
e_man2/train/LJ037-0097.wav|4|Smith subsequently told a Commission staff member
e_man2/train/LJ037-0107.wav|4|They saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver held high in his right hand. According to Callaway, the man crossed to the west side of Patton.
e_man2/train/LJ037-0117.wav|4|Both men picked Oswald as the man who had run south on Patton with a gun in his hand.
e_man2/train/LJ037-0127.wav|4|Four men -- Warren Reynolds, Harold Russell, Pat Patterson, and L. J. Lewis
e_man2/train/LJ037-0137.wav|4|He was then shown two photographs of Oswald and he advised that Oswald was, quote, unquestionably, end quote, the man he saw.
e_man2/train/LJ037-0147.wav|4|It was the unanimous and unequivocal testimony of expert witnesses before the Commission that these used cartridge cases were fired from the revolver

e_man2/train/LJ037-0207.wav|4|Michaelis furnished the shipping copy of the invoice, and the Railway Express Agency shipping documents, showing that
e_man2/train/LJ037-0217.wav|4|Police found an empty revolver holster when they searched Oswald's room on Beckley Avenue after his arrest.
e_man2/train/LJ037-0227.wav|4|Mrs. Markham told Poe
e_man2/train/LJ037-0237.wav|4|When interviewed by FBI agents on January 21, 1964,
e_man2/train/LJ037-0247.wav|4|Marina Oswald also identified Commission Exhibit No. 162, the jacket found by Captain Westbrook, as her husband's second jacket.
e_man2/train/LJ037-0257.wav|4|Scoggins thought it was lighter.
e_man2/train/LJ037-0267.wav|4|to the exclusion of all other weapons,
e_man2/train/LJ038-0008.wav|4|Brewer knew from radio broadcasts that the President had been shot and that a patrolman had also been shot in Oak Cliff.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0018.wav|4|Shortly thereafter, Johnny Brewer, who had come from the nearby shoestore, asked Mrs. Postal whether the fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0028.wav|4|Brewer met McDonald and the other policemen at the alley exit door,
e_man2/train/LJ038-0038.wav|4|McDonald struck back with his right hand and grabbed the gun with his left hand. They both fell into the seats.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0048.wav|4|Testimony of a firearms expert before the Commission established that the hammer of the revolver never touched the shell in the chamber.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0058.wav|4|Officer Ray Hawkins said
e_man2/train/LJ038-0068.wav|4|cursing a little bit and hollering police brutality, end quote.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0078.wav|4|Oswald was questioned intermittently for approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m., on November 22, and 11 a.m.,
e_man2/train/LJ038-0088.wav|4|The results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0098.wav|4|Denial of Rifle Ownership
e_man2/train/LJ038-0108.wav|4|that they had superimposed upon the photographs a rifle and a revolver. He told Fritz a number of times that the smaller photograph

e_man2/train/LJ038-0128.wav|4|He also denied that he had received the rifle through this box.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0138.wav|4|When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald lied again.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0148.wav|4|Actions During and After Shooting
e_man2/train/LJ038-0158.wav|4|Jarman testified that he ate his lunch on the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and that he neither ate lunch with nor saw Oswald.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0168.wav|4|There were no eyewitnesses, although a 14-year-old boy in a neighboring house claimed that immediately after the shooting

e_man2/train/LJ038-0200.wav|4|the city jail is located at the end of the bridge through which we always passed on going to the city (right in the beginning of the city after crossing the bridge).
e_man2/train/LJ038-0210.wav|4|according to Marina Oswald when he learned on the radio and in the newspapers the next day that he had missed,
e_man2/train/LJ038-0220.wav|4|Oswald had paid the first month's rent in advance on March 2, 1963,
e_man2/train/LJ038-0230.wav|4|The county jail is at the corner of Houston and Main Streets, quote, right in the beginning of the city, end quote, after one travels through the underpass.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0240.wav|4|The third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the entrance to General Walker's driveway from a back alley.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0250.wav|4|Another photograph of railroad tracks found among Oswald's possessions was not identified by his wife,
e_man2/train/LJ038-0260.wav|4|On November 30, 1963, the FBI requested the bullet for ballistics examination;
e_man2/train/LJ038-0270.wav|4|which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0280.wav|4|And for purposes of probative value, for whatever it might be worth,
e_man2/train/LJ038-0290.wav|4|provide important corroboration for her account of the incident.
e_man2/train/LJ038-0300.wav|4|Based on (1) the contents of the note which Oswald left for his wife on April 10, 1963,
e_man2/train/LJ039-0004.wav|4|Chapter 4. The Assassin: Part 8.
e_man2/train/LJ039-0014.wav|4|Marina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11, 1964,
e_man2/train/LJ039-0024.wav|4|She stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving the house. Quote, I couldn't keep him from going out if he really wanted to, end quote.
e_man2/train/LJ039-0034.wav|4|The Commission has concluded, therefore, that regardless of what Oswald may have said to his wife
e_man2/train/LJ039-0044.wav|4|Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit took place on April 23rd.
e_man2/train/LJ039-0054.wav|4|Oswald's Rifle Capability

e_man2/train/LJ039-0114.wav|4|When asked to explain the different scores achieved by Oswald on the two occasions when he fired for record,
e_man2/train/LJ039-0124.wav|4|End quote. Major Anderson concluded, quote, I would say that as compared to other Marines receiving the same type of training,
e_man2/train/LJ039-0134.wav|4|During one of his leaves from the Marines, Oswald hunted with his brother Robert,
e_man2/train/LJ039-0144.wav|4|Oswald told her he was going to practice with it.
e_man2/train/LJ039-0154.wav|4|4.8 to 5.6 seconds if the second shot missed,
e_man2/train/LJ039-0164.wav|4|from a tower at three silhouette targets at distances of 175, 240, and 265 feet.
e_man2/train/LJ039-0174.wav|4|The marksmen took as much time as they wanted for the first target and all hit the target.
e_man2/train/LJ039-0184.wav|4|Considering the various probabilities which may have prevailed during the actual assassination,
e_man2/train/LJ039-0194.wav|4|All three of the firers in these tests
e_man2/train/LJ039-0204.wav|4|Frazier later fired four groups of three shots at a distance of 100 yards in 5.9, 6.2,

e_man2/train/LJ039-0234.wav|4|the Commission concluded that Oswald was capable of accomplishing this second hit even if there was an intervening shot which missed.
e_man2/train/LJ039-0244.wav|4|killed Dallas Police Officer J. D. Tippit in an apparent attempt to escape,
e_man2/train/LJ040-0006.wav|4|The Commission has considered many possible motives for the assassination, including those which might flow from Oswald's commitment to Marxism or communism,
e_man2/train/LJ040-0016.wav|4|and in the history of his life which does give some insight into his character and, possibly, into the motives for his act.
e_man2/train/LJ040-0026.wav|4|He had very few, if any, close relationships with other people and he appeared to have great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world.
e_man2/train/LJ040-0036.wav|4|and, apparently seriously, as a political prophet -- a man who said that after 20 years he would be prime minister.

e_man2/train/LJ040-0076.wav|4|In the fall of that year John Pic and Robert Oswald went to a military academy
e_man2/train/LJ040-0086.wav|4|In the fall of 1948 she told John Pic and Robert Oswald
e_man2/train/LJ040-0096.wav|4|Pic said, quote,
e_man2/train/LJ040-0106.wav|4|It also appears that Lee tried to tag along with his older brothers
e_man2/train/LJ040-0116.wav|4|who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother, having struck her on at least one occasion.
e_man2/train/LJ040-0126.wav|4|Oswald was remanded for psychiatric observation to Youth House, an institution in which children are kept for psychiatric observation
e_man2/train/LJ040-0136.wav|4|There are children in here who have killed people, and smoke. I want to get out, end quote,
e_man2/train/LJ040-0146.wav|4|He noted that Lee liked to give the impression that he did not care for other people but preferred to keep to himself,
e_man2/train/LJ040-0156.wav|4|No finding of neurological impairment or psychotic mental changes could be made.
e_man2/train/LJ040-0166.wav|4|She also noted that there was, quote, a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved, affectionless youngster
e_man2/train/LJ040-0176.wav|4|He admitted to fantasies about being powerful and sometimes hurting and killing people, but refused to elaborate on them.
e_man2/train/LJ040-0186.wav|4|Lee scored an IQ of 118 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.
e_man2/train/LJ040-0196.wav|4|into which he appeared to be retreating.
e_man2/train/LJ040-0206.wav|4|that Lee's withdrawal was a form of, quote, violent but silent protest against his neglect by her
e_man2/train/LJ040-0216.wav|4|In view of his experiences when he visited his relatives in New Orleans in the spring of 1950, and his other solitary habits,
e_man2/train/LJ040-0226.wav|4|I couldn't in all honesty sincerely say such a thing.
e_man2/train/LJ040-0236.wav|4|and when his mother failed to cooperate in any way with school authorities,
e_man2/train/LJ041-0006.wav|4|His mother exercised little control over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go on in school.
e_man2/train/LJ041-0016.wav|4|Voebel took Oswald back to the school to attend to his wounds, and their, quote, mild friendship, end quote, stemmed from that incident.
e_man2/train/LJ041-0026.wav|4|from which Oswald appeared to suffer.
e_man2/train/LJ041-0036.wav|4|He was a little dismayed at this, and he said that he couldn't find any that would show any interest in him as a Communist,
e_man2/train/LJ041-0046.wav|4|There is evidence that Oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join the Marines by the fact that his brother Robert had done so
e_man2/train/LJ041-0056.wav|4|in his intense desire to join the Marines and get away from his surroundings and his mother.
e_man2/train/LJ041-0066.wav|4|his general personality would alienate the group against him, end quote.
e_man2/train/LJ041-0076.wav|4|and put them in positions of prominence, end quote. Oswald manifested this feeling about authority by baiting his officers.
e_man2/train/LJ041-0086.wav|4|and then used the, quote, special treatment, end quote, he received as an example of the way in which he was being picked on and, quote,
e_man2/train/LJ041-0096.wav|4|Normally, it would be a good type of literature; and the one that I recall was "Leaves of Grass," by Walt Whitman, end quote.
e_man2/train/LJ041-0106.wav|4|At the court-martial hearing which followed, Oswald admitted that he had been rather drunk when the incident occurred.
e_man2/train/LJ041-0116.wav|4|after it was learned that he had defected to the Soviet Union.
e_man2/train/LJ041-0126.wav|4|But while we were in Russia he spoke well of him. Lee said that when he would return to the United States he would vote for him for Governor, end quote.

e_man2/train/LJ041-0146.wav|4|it was more in terms of a general hostility against the government and its representatives rather than a grudge against any particular person.

e_man2/train/LJ041-0166.wav|4|in honor of some retiring noncommissioned officers, an event which they both approached with little enthusiasm.
e_man2/train/LJ041-0176.wav|4|He recalled that Oswald had a specific interest in Latin America, particularly Cuba,
e_man2/train/LJ041-0186.wav|4|as some kind of tribunal,
e_man2/train/LJ041-0196.wav|4|even though as his wife suggested, that interest may have been motivated by a desire to gain attention. He used his Marxist and associated activities

e_man2/train/LJ042-0023.wav|4|and that he went there, quote, only to find freedom. I could never have been personally happy in the U.S., end quote.
e_man2/train/LJ042-0033.wav|4|of his concomitant hatred of the United States, which was most clearly expressed in his November 26,
e_man2/train/LJ042-0044.wav|4|I will not say your grandchildren will live under communism, look for yourself at history, look at a world map! America is a dicing country,
e_man2/train/LJ042-0054.wav|4|Oswald told his brother, quote, on what terms I want this arrangement, end quote. He advised Robert that: 1.

e_man2/train/LJ042-0124.wav|4|they don't seem to be especially enthusiastic about any of the "collective" duties, a natural feeling.
e_man2/train/LJ042-0134.wav|4|The psychological effects of that change must have been highly unsettling. It should be remembered
e_man2/train/LJ042-0144.wav|4|After the assassination she wrote that, quote,

e_man2/train/LJ044-0147.wav|4|and in late June or early July he told his wife that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union with her. She said that he was extremely upset,

e_man2/train/LJ044-0218.wav|4|In this connection it should be noted that in speaking of the Worker, Oswald told Michael Paine, apparently in all seriousness, that, quote,

e_man2/train/LJ045-0199.wav|4|Whether he thought about assassinating the President over the weekend can never be known, but it is reasonably certain
e_man2/train/LJ045-0209.wav|4|but it was also, at least in part, because his wife did not want to live there with him.
e_man2/train/LJ045-0219.wav|4|that he wanted to make peace with her and bring his family to Dallas where they could live with him again.
e_man2/train/LJ045-0229.wav|4|He then killed Patrolman Tippit when that police officer apparently tried to question him after he had left his roominghouse and he vigorously resisted arrest

e_man2/train/LJ047-0025.wav|4|During the next 2 years the FBI continued to accumulate information,
e_man2/train/LJ047-0035.wav|4|Oswald's file at the Department of State Passport Office was reviewed in June 1962.
e_man2/train/LJ047-0045.wav|4|and promised to advise the FBI if he heard from them.
e_man2/train/LJ047-0055.wav|4|It does not preclude the agent in charge of the case from reopening it if he feels that further work should be done.
e_man2/train/LJ047-0065.wav|4|This information led Hosty to review Oswald's file, from which he learned that Oswald had become a subscriber to the Worker,
e_man2/train/LJ047-0075.wav|4|Hosty had inquired earlier and found no evidence that it was functioning in the Dallas area.
e_man2/train/LJ047-0085.wav|4|The FBI had not asked to be informed of any effort by Oswald to obtain a passport,
e_man2/train/LJ047-0095.wav|4|On the next day, he asked the New Orleans police to arrange for him to be interviewed by the FBI.
e_man2/train/LJ047-0105.wav|4|In Quigley's judgment,
e_man2/train/LJ047-0115.wav|4|Several days later, the Bureau received additional evidence that Oswald had lied to Agent Quigley.

e_man2/train/LJ048-0105.wav|4|but these routes would not have been in accordance with the White House staff instructions given the Secret Service for a desirable motorcade route.
e_man2/train/LJ048-0116.wav|4|Agent Lawson was not given written instructions concerning the Dallas trip or advice about any peculiar problems which it might involve;
e_man2/train/LJ048-0126.wav|4|Special Agent in Charge Sorrels testified that the advance preparations followed on this occasion were, quote, pretty much the same, end quote,
e_man2/train/LJ048-0136.wav|4|In the description of the important aspects of the advance preparations,
e_man2/train/LJ048-0146.wav|4|Discussions with the Dallas authorities and requests made of them were entirely informal.
e_man2/train/LJ048-0156.wav|4|and suggested the desirability of such a statement.
e_man2/train/LJ048-0166.wav|4|But on out-of-town trips where the route is decided on and made public only a few days in advance,
e_man2/train/LJ048-0176.wav|4|Even if it were possible with a vastly larger force of security officers to do so, many observers have felt
e_man2/train/LJ048-0186.wav|4|Instead of such advance precautions, the Secret Service depended in part on the efforts of local law enforcement personnel stationed along the route.
e_man2/train/LJ048-0196.wav|4|According to Captain Lawrence, quote,
e_man2/train/LJ048-0206.wav|4|As the motorcade approached Elm Street
e_man2/train/LJ048-0216.wav|4|stated that he scanned the Depository Building, but not sufficiently to be alerted by anything in the windows or on the roof.
e_man2/train/LJ048-0226.wav|4|All of the agents stayed for a drink of beer, or in several cases, a mixed drink.
e_man2/train/LJ048-0236.wav|4|There is no indication that any of the agents who visited the Cellar Coffee House had any intoxicating drink at that establishment.

e_man2/train/LJ048-0266.wav|4|and special agents cooperating with them on Presidential and similar protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for official duty
e_man2/train/LJ048-0276.wav|4|Since he was convinced that this was not the case, he believed that it would be unfair to the agents and their families to take explicit disciplinary measures.
e_man2/train/LJ048-0286.wav|4|Nor is this goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours, and lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep.

e_man2/train/LJ050-0258.wav|4|Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment,
e_man2/train/LJ050-0268.wav|4|The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.

e_woman2/train/LJ002-0145.wav|5|Often a commissioner had to leave the bench because he was himself a party to the suit that was sub judice.
e_woman2/train/LJ002-0155.wav|5|for which the costs were 6 shillings 10 pence.

e_woman2/train/LJ002-0175.wav|5|The costs in heavier debts always doubled the sum; if the arrest was made in the country it trebled it.
e_woman2/train/LJ002-0185.wav|5|The King's Bench was a national prison, in which were confined all debtors arrested for debt or for contempt of the court of the King's Bench.
e_woman2/train/LJ002-0195.wav|5|Besides these, a number had the privilege of a "run on the key," which allowed a prisoner to go into the rules for the day.

e_woman2/train/LJ002-0245.wav|5|The prison was a nest of abuses, like its neighbor the King's Bench
e_woman2/train/LJ002-0255.wav|5|A court of the collegians was held every Monday to manage its affairs, at which all prisoners were required to attend.

e_woman2/train/LJ002-0315.wav|5|But this weekly pittance did not go far when the debtors' side was crowded, as it often was;
e_woman2/train/LJ002-0325.wav|5|or the sixpenny allowance was claimed for the creditors, which seldom happened, owing to the expense the process entailed.
e_woman2/train/LJ002-0335.wav|5|so were candles, salt, pepper, mops and brooms. But the latter could have been of little service. Dirt prevailed everywhere;
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0007.wav|5|hundreds of women and children came in every morning to spend the day there, and there was no limitation whatever to the numbers of visitors admitted to the debtors' side.

e_woman2/train/LJ003-0047.wav|5|Newgate continued to be a reproach to those responsible for its management.
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0057.wav|5|A further sub-classification was attempted by separating at night those charged with misdemeanors from those charged with felony,
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0067.wav|5|in the then existing state of the law,
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0077.wav|5|Two of the untried were for murder, and several for house-breaking and highway robbery.
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0087.wav|5|These often remained in Newgate for six months, sometimes a year, in some cases longer;
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0097.wav|5|with convicts of all ages and characters, to render it next to impossible but that, with the obliteration of all sense of self-respect,
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0107.wav|5|he slept in the same bed with a highwayman on one side, and a man charged with murder on the other.
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0117.wav|5|A bribe to the judge was certain to secure acquittal, and the neglect of the formality was as certainly followed by condemnation.

e_woman2/train/LJ003-0137.wav|5|and I learned he had been up with the others the whole night.
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0147.wav|5|Besides the jail fees, there was garnish of half-a-guinea, collected by the steward,
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0157.wav|5|The best accommodation the jail could offer was reserved for the prisoners on the state side,
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0167.wav|5|The fee for admission to the state side, as fixed by the table of fees, was three guineas, but Mr. Newman declared that he never took more than two.

e_woman2/train/LJ003-0207.wav|5|For while Roman Catholics and Dissenters were encouraged to see ministers of their own persuasion,
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0217.wav|5|The condemned occupied an open pew in the center of the chapel, hung with black; in front of them, upon a table, was a black coffin in full view.
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0227.wav|5|So unjust and unequal was the system, that the allowance to convicted criminals was better than that of the innocent debtor,
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0237.wav|5|The fees on reception and discharge must be deemed exorbitant, when it is remembered the impoverished class who usually crowded the jail;
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0247.wav|5|or the faithful discharge of some petty office, such as gatesman or captain of a ward.
e_woman2/train/LJ003-0257.wav|5|Searches were made certainly, but they were too often superficial, or they might be evaded by a trifling bribe.

e_woman2/train/LJ004-0080.wav|5|because they are not specified in his sentence; he is therefore entitled to a wholesome atmosphere,
e_woman2/train/LJ004-0090.wav|5|Again, the 22 Charles II. c 20 ordered the jailer to keep felons and debtors "separate and apart from one another,
e_woman2/train/LJ004-0100.wav|5|An infirmary, consisting of two distinct rooms, one for males and one for females, should be provided for the separate accommodation of the sick.
e_woman2/train/LJ004-0110.wav|5|It was made incumbent upon the justices to provide distinct places of confinement for five classes of prisoners, viz.

e_woman2/train/LJ004-0190.wav|5|There were eighty-four separate sleeping-cells, and unless the jail was overcrowded, every inmate passed the night alone,
e_woman2/train/LJ004-0200.wav|5|Another jail, that of Ilchester, was also worthy of all commendation. It exhibited all the good points of that at Bury.
e_woman2/train/LJ004-0210.wav|5|There was a prison laundry too, where all the prisoners' linen was regularly washed.
e_woman2/train/LJ004-0220.wav|5|for breakfast a pint of gruel; for dinner half a pound of boiled meat, or a quart of soup with vegetables, on alternate days.
e_woman2/train/LJ004-0230.wav|5|It was found that shackles might be safely dispensed with, even in the case of the most desperate characters.

e_woman2/train/LJ005-0111.wav|5|In a county prison adjoining the metropolis, the separation between the male and female quarters was supposed to be accomplished by the erection of an iron railing;
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0121.wav|5|By degrees, however,
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0131.wav|5|In many places too where the prisoners earned money by their work, they were granted a portion of it for their own use after proper deduction for maintenance.

e_woman2/train/LJ005-0191.wav|5|The Society proceeded to support this indictment by facts. It is much the old story.
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0201.wav|5|as is shown by the report of the Commissioners to inquire into the state of the municipal corporations in 1835.
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0211.wav|5|the jail consisted of six cells, frequently so damp that the moisture trickled down the walls; there was not space for air or exercise,
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0221.wav|5|and the panes were filled in with oiled paper, an insufficient protection against the weather;
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0231.wav|5|The city justices had not fulfilled this obligation.
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0241.wav|5|till the whole body of the slaves were manumitted in 1833.
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0251.wav|5|Again in 1835 prisons and their inmates became once more the care of the senate, and the subject was taken up this time by the House of Lords.
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0261.wav|5|As a means of securing this uniformity,
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0271.wav|5|As a means of increasing the severity of imprisonment, letters and visits from outside should not be permitted during the first six months of an imprisonment.
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0281.wav|5|that the greatest mischief followed from the intercourse which was still permitted in so many prisons; to use its words,
e_woman2/train/LJ005-0291.wav|5|In some large towns, as at Berwick on Tweed, Southampton, and Southwark, they (the prisons) are in a very discreditable condition.

e_woman2/train/LJ006-0031.wav|5|that punishment must be reformatory as well as deterrent.
e_woman2/train/LJ006-0042.wav|5|Relapse was rapid and inevitable, so that the latter state of the prison was worse than the first.
e_woman2/train/LJ006-0052.wav|5|The sum total thus produced was inconsiderable compared with the hundreds that had formerly filled the jail,
e_woman2/train/LJ006-0062.wav|5|In another part there were men charged with and convicted of unnatural offenses shut up with lads of tender years;
e_woman2/train/LJ006-0072.wav|5|I shall have occasion to speak again, and more at length, of Mr. Cope's careless and perfunctory discharge
e_woman2/train/LJ006-0082.wav|5|and this particular official took excellent care to select as residents for his own ward those most suitable from his own point of view.
e_woman2/train/LJ006-0092.wav|5|and under the scanty covering of a couple of dirty stable-rugs apiece.
e_woman2/train/LJ006-0102.wav|5|This, too, was in the depth of the winter, and during a most inclement season.

e_woman2/train/LJ006-0122.wav|5|and by these payments a wardsman had been known to amass as much as £40.
e_woman2/train/LJ006-0132.wav|5|All the wardsmen alike were more or less irresponsible.

e_woman2/train/LJ006-0182.wav|5|Under the reckless contempt for regulations,
e_woman2/train/LJ006-0192.wav|5|There was no school for adults; only the boys were taught anything, and their instructor, with his assistant, were convicted prisoners.
e_woman2/train/LJ006-0202.wav|5|The news-vendor was also a tobacconist,

e_woman2/train/LJ010-0089.wav|5|While a few secured the servants, the rest were to fall upon Lord Harrowby and his guests.
e_woman2/train/LJ010-0099.wav|5|The conspirators were in a loft, approached by a ladder and a trap-door, access through which could only be obtained one by one.
e_woman2/train/LJ010-0109.wav|5|Thistlewood made a long and rambling defense, the chief features of which were abuse of Lord Sidmouth, and the vilification of the informer Edwards.
e_woman2/train/LJ010-0119.wav|5|It was asserted, not without foundation, at these trials, that Edwards repeatedly incited the associates he was betraying
e_woman2/train/LJ010-0129.wav|5|but Ings said he hoped God would be more merciful to him than men had been.
e_woman2/train/LJ010-0139.wav|5|After the five bodies had hung for half-an-hour, a man in a mask came forward to complete the sentence.

e_woman2/train/LJ010-0249.wav|5|There was some doubt as to whether the pistol when fired was actually loaded with ball, but the jury brought in a verdict of guilty

e_woman2/train/LJ014-0095.wav|5|On the third day his friends began to inquire for him,
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0105.wav|5|He was lying on his face, his legs tied up to his hips so as to allow of the body fitting into the hole.
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0115.wav|5|and they had given information to the police.
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0125.wav|5|Mrs. Manning was not without personal charms;
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0135.wav|5|It was against common sense to charge her with murdering the only friend she had in the world;
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0146.wav|5|They had to handcuff her by force against the most violent resistance, and still she raged and stormed,
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0156.wav|5|and through all ate heartily at every meal, slept soundly at nights, and talked with cheerfulness on almost any subject.

e_woman2/train/LJ014-0206.wav|5|His captors, it may be added (Lerigo and Allen), were warmly commended by the judge for their courage and activity.

e_woman2/train/LJ014-0226.wav|5|Only a few have vied with Cannon in fiendish cruelty and brutality.
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0236.wav|5|Barthelemy was generally supposed to have been a secret agent of the French police.
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0246.wav|5|Thus, when a payment was made by the company, the amount disbursed was carried to account in the general books from its entry in the passbook,
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0256.wav|5|It seems incredible that this passbook, which when produced in court
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0266.wav|5|No one cared too closely to inquire into the sources of wealth. Some said he was a fortunate speculator in stocks,
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0277.wav|5|An inquiry was at once set on foot, and the frauds were traced to Watts.
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0288.wav|5|That same evening he committed suicide in Newgate.
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0298.wav|5|Strange to say, a second suicide occurred in Newgate the same night,

e_woman2/train/LJ014-0318.wav|5|Another set of frauds, which resembled those of Pries in principle, although not in practice, were soon afterwards discovered.
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0329.wav|5|and so developed his business that in one year his transactions amounted to a couple of millions of pounds.
e_woman2/train/LJ014-0339.wav|5|asked Davidson and Gordon, a firm with which Cole was closely allied, whether the warrants meant goods or nothing.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0009.wav|5|Cole's difficulties increased more and more; warrant-holders came down upon him demanding to realize their goods.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0019.wav|5|The Strahan of the firm which came to grief was a Snow who changed his name for a fortune of £200,000;
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0029.wav|5|In December 1851 the balance sheet showed a deficiency of upwards of £70,000.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0039.wav|5|Money they must have, and money they raised to meet their urgent necessities upon the balances and securities deposited with them by their customers.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0049.wav|5|They admitted that they had made away with many of the securities entrusted to their keeping.

e_woman2/train/LJ015-0109.wav|5|and he discussed the latter with appetite, but begged that they would never give him curry again, as he did not like it.

e_woman2/train/LJ015-0149.wav|5|peas at ten shillings a quart, five-guinea pines, and early asparagus were to be found on his table.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0159.wav|5|In his person he was neat and fastidious;
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0169.wav|5|It was at once decided at the board to make a thorough examination of all his books.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0179.wav|5|The Central Criminal Court, when the trial came on,
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0189.wav|5|and the prototype of a class not uncommon in our later days
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0199.wav|5|The improved methods of locomotion had put a stop to these depredations. People traveled in company, as a rule;
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0209.wav|5|Burgess detailed the whole system of transmission.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0219.wav|5|At last he decided to enlist one Tester, a clerk in the traffic department, whom he thought would prove a likely tool.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0229.wav|5|who quickly took the wax impression, handed it back to Pierce; Pierce replaced it, left the office, and the thing was done.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0239.wav|5|Just as the train was starting Agar slipped into the van with Burgess, and Pierce got into a first-class carriage.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0249.wav|5|The theft was discovered at Boulogne, when the boxes were found not to weigh exactly what they ought. But no clue was obtained to the thieves,
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0259.wav|5|Agar too, in Newgate, heard how Pierce had treated him, and at once readily turned approver.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0269.wav|5|He was known to the whole criminal fraternity as a high-class receiver of stolen goods, a negotiator more especially of stolen paper,
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0279.wav|5|One stroke of luck which he turned to great account
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0289.wav|5|As each transaction was carried out from a different address, and a different messenger always employed,
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0299.wav|5|and the circumstances were deemed sufficiently suspicious to warrant the arrest of the gentlemen at Yarmouth on a charge of forgery and conspiracy.
e_woman2/train/LJ015-0309.wav|5|and the judge, in passing sentence on him of transportation for life, expressed deep regret that "the ingenuity, skill, and talent,
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0005.wav|5|Year after year prisoners determined to get free, and occasionally succeeded in their efforts.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0015.wav|5|White, when taxed with his attempt, admitted that the accusation was true, and spoke "with pride and satisfaction of the practicability of his scheme."

e_woman2/train/LJ016-0045.wav|5|and at length reached a point opposite the top of the building containing the condemned wards. This had been a perilous and painful task;
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0055.wav|5|He traversed vainly all the roofs in Newgate Street,
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0065.wav|5|To walk out into the street was an easy affair, and he was now free, with one and fourpence in his pocket and a shirt and trousers for all his clothing.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0075.wav|5|It was for some time after this a constant practice to go up the chimneys in the hopes of escaping by the flue.

e_woman2/train/LJ016-0096.wav|5|They were penal servitude men, their names Bell, Brown, and Barry, and they were awaiting transfer to Leicester,
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0106.wav|5|with a civil note to the governor, saying he had no further use for them. All three fugitives were recaptured,
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0116.wav|5|The doors, through incomplete knowledge of prison needs, were not, as now, sheeted with iron.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0126.wav|5|The top of the wall was gained without difficulty.

e_woman2/train/LJ016-0196.wav|5|He accepted, having at first Tom Cheshire as his assistant, then for a time, when Cheshire was dismissed for drunkenness, a man named Osborne.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0206.wav|5|he was also at liberty to engage himself in the country, where he demanded and was paid £10 on each occasion.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0216.wav|5|That very ancient perquisite the convict's clothes was never claimed by Calcraft, and it may be doubted whether he was entitled to it.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0226.wav|5|To this curious etiquette was due the appointment of an official whose office has long since disappeared, "the yeoman of the halter,"
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0236.wav|5|Marwood being, on the other hand, in favor of giving a man as much rope as possible.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0246.wav|5|Over the door, in gilt letters, were the words "Crown Office"; in the window was a pile of official envelopes, ostentatiously displayed,

e_woman2/train/LJ016-0266.wav|5|No notion that they were assisting at a vindication of the law filled the minds of those present with dread.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0278.wav|5|and which contributed in no small degree to the introduction of private executions. A great crowd was expected, and a great crowd came.

e_woman2/train/LJ016-0308.wav|5|yet the witnesses were not unanimous.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0318.wav|5|Other officials, great lawyers, governors of prisons, and chaplains supported this view.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0328.wav|5|Nevertheless, in the very next session
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0338.wav|5|inside the jail was Colonel Frazer, the chief commissioner of the city police, and at no great distance, although in the background,
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0349.wav|5|that of Alexander Mackay, who murdered his mistress at Norton Folgate by beating her with a rolling-pin and furnace-rake,
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0359.wav|5|Private executions at their first introduction were not popular with the Newgate officials, and for intelligible reasons.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0369.wav|5|upon them devolved the painful duty of cutting down the body and preparing for the inquest.
e_woman2/train/LJ016-0380.wav|5|with hope to the last. There is always the chance of a flaw in the indictment, of a missing witness, or extenuating circumstances.

e_woman2/train/LJ017-0025.wav|5|the justice of the sentence was doubted at the time.

e_woman2/train/LJ017-0045.wav|5|The Central Criminal Court was crowded to suffocation.
e_woman2/train/LJ017-0055.wav|5|Throughout his trial he preserved an impassive countenance, but he clearly took a deep interest in all that passed.
e_woman2/train/LJ017-0065.wav|5|I ought also to confess the others: I mean my wife and my brother's. End quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ017-0075.wav|5|There is every reason to suppose that he poisoned his wife to obtain possession of this sum upon her death.
e_woman2/train/LJ017-0085.wav|5|Palmer's plan was to administer poison in quantities insufficient to cause death, but enough to produce illness which would account for death.
e_woman2/train/LJ017-0095.wav|5|The purchase by Palmer of strychnia was proved.
e_woman2/train/LJ017-0105.wav|5|Cook's death was horrible

e_woman2/train/LJ017-0125.wav|5|He never actually said that he was not guilty, but he was confident he would not be convicted.
e_woman2/train/LJ017-0135.wav|5|Dove, a fiendish brute, found from the evidence in that case that he could kill his wife, whom he hated,

e_woman2/train/LJ017-0175.wav|5|The circumstances were strange. Mrs. Wilson had gone to the chemist's for medicine,
e_woman2/train/LJ017-0185.wav|5|She was in good health on leaving home, and had with her a large sum of money.

e_woman2/train/LJ017-0245.wav|5|On the 2nd October they sighted land, ten miles distant;
e_woman2/train/LJ017-0255.wav|5|repaired there secretly, and so gave information to the Brazilian authorities.

e_woman2/train/LJ018-0273.wav|5|Tarpey was caught through his wife,
e_woman2/train/LJ018-0283.wav|5|and by means of forged letters of credit and introduction from London, obtained large sums from continental banks, in Berlin,

e_woman2/train/LJ018-0333.wav|5|it was the principal incentive with Kate Webster, that fierce and brutal female savage who took the life of her mistress at Richmond.
e_woman2/train/LJ018-0343.wav|5|In this case the tie was unsanctified, but it was not more inconvenient than that which urged Greenacre to a similar crime.
e_woman2/train/LJ018-0353.wav|5|Wainwright's demeanor after sentence has been described in the last chapter.
e_woman2/train/LJ018-0363.wav|5|She was found guilty.

e_woman2/train/LJ019-0035.wav|5|and the total number of separate cells provided amounted to eleven thousand odd.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0045.wav|5|Not less remarkable than this diverse interpretation of a manifest duty
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0055.wav|5|High authorities were in favor of continuous separation.

e_woman2/train/LJ019-0095.wav|5|which was yet under full control, and might be made to work corn-mills or prove otherwise productive;
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0105.wav|5|and that a new system of prison discipline should be introduced.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0115.wav|5|In his proposal he dwelt much upon the humanizing effects of healthful open-air toil,
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0125.wav|5|But an open farm of a thousand acres would have offered abundant chances of escape, which some at least would have attempted, probably with success.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0135.wav|5|There was no longer, or at worst but rarely, and for short periods, the same overcrowding.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0145.wav|5|But reformation was only skin deep. Below the surface many of the old evils still rankled.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0155.wav|5|The enforcement of discipline depended upon the want of honor among thieves.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0165.wav|5|The rule became general as regards the prison dress; hitherto clothing had been issued only to such as were destitute or in rags, and all classes of prisoners,
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0175.wav|5|Well-founded complaints had been made of the want of heating appliances in the jail.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0185.wav|5|Lord John, with great fairness, admitted that the whole of this burthen could not be imposed upon the city
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0195.wav|5|A proviso was also made that the magistrates should continue to exercise full control over the new jail,
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0205.wav|5|In 1845 the Jail Committee brought forward a definite proposal to purchase ground in the immediate vicinity for the erection of a new jail.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0215.wav|5|Why not move the city prison bodily into this more rural spot, with its purer air and greater breathing space?
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0225.wav|5|In 1857
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0235.wav|5|With the last re-edification of Newgate, a work executed some seven centuries after the first stone of the old jail was laid,
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0245.wav|5|The inquiry was most searching and complete, and the committee spoke plainly in its report.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0255.wav|5|Great numbers were not lighted at night, and were without means by which their inmates could communicate, in case of urgent necessity, with their keepers.

e_woman2/train/LJ019-0275.wav|5|that the committee of 1863 fully endorsed Sir Joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0285.wav|5|In one jail fifteen hours were spent in bed out of the twenty-four. This was in keeping with other grave defects and omissions.

e_woman2/train/LJ019-0335.wav|5|The books and journals he was to keep were minutely specified, and his constant presence in or near the jail was insisted upon.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0345.wav|5|The Act of 1865 also encouraged and empowered the local authorities to "alter, enlarge, or rebuild" their prisons.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0355.wav|5|came up in all respects to modern requirements.
e_woman2/train/LJ019-0365.wav|5|and with the concurrence of the other authority, and on payment. A few provisos governed these rather extensive powers.

e_woman2/train/LJ019-0385.wav|5|Mr. (now Sir Richard) Cross, having applied himself vigorously to the task of reorganizing the whole system, became convinced

e_woman2/train/LJ024-0045.wav|5|if the appointment of such justices can be called "packing the Courts,"
e_woman2/train/LJ024-0055.wav|5|We think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary

e_woman2/train/LJ025-0052.wav|5|the greatest and most rapid revolution which biological science has ever undergone was effected by the application of the modern microscope
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0062.wav|5|under particular circumstances, the contents of the cells of certain water-weeds were set free and moved about with considerable velocity
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0072.wav|5|Hence the teleological argument for Cuvier's first diagnostic character
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0082.wav|5|But although Cuvier's leading diagnosis of the animal from the plant will not stand a strict test,
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0092.wav|5|It is now established that nitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0102.wav|5|yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0112.wav|5|With a qualification, to be considered presently, the answer to this question is undoubtedly in the affirmative.
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0122.wav|5|The contractility which is the fundamental condition of locomotion," continues Huxley,
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0132.wav|5|just as the body of a snail contracts into its shell when one of its "horns" is irritated.
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0142.wav|5|greatly as these have been extended by modern improvements of the microscope, and that a nerve is, in its essence,
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0152.wav|5|So that I know not where we can hope to find any absolute distinction between animals and plants, unless we return to their mode of nutrition
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0162.wav|5|will be vastly greater than the weight of the same substances contained in the bean from which it sprang.
e_woman2/train/LJ025-0172.wav|5|In fact, the bean obtains two of the absolutely indispensable elements of its substance from two distinct sources.
e_woman2/train/LJ026-0006.wav|5|for the manufacture of starchy food from gaseous matter.
e_woman2/train/LJ026-0016.wav|5|They ingest solid proteinaceous food,
e_woman2/train/LJ026-0026.wav|5|As in the liquefaction of gases, there is a "critical point" at which the substance under experiment is neither gaseous nor liquid.
e_woman2/train/LJ026-0036.wav|5|and then a balance must be struck and the doubtful form placed in the kingdom with which it has, on the whole, most points in common.

e_woman2/train/LJ034-0184.wav|5|Approximately 1 week after the assassination, according to Fisher, policemen showed him a picture of Oswald.
e_woman2/train/LJ034-0194.wav|5|Their testimony is of probative value, however, because their limited description is consistent with that of the man who has been found by the Commission,
e_woman2/train/LJ034-0204.wav|5|and not to his race.
e_woman2/train/LJ034-0214.wav|5|Investigation has established that Altgens' picture was taken approximately 2 seconds after the firing of the shot
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0005.wav|5|The Commission has found that Oswald's movements, as described by these witnesses,

e_woman2/train/LJ035-0025.wav|5|I am a building manager. Follow me, officer, and I will show you, end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0035.wav|5|Because the stairway itself is enclosed, neither Baker nor Truly could see anything on the second-floor hallway until they reached the landing at the top of the stairs.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0045.wav|5|Baker said, quote, He [Truly] had already started around the bend to come to the next elevator going up,
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0055.wav|5|Along a side wall of the lunchroom was a soft drink rending machine, but at that time the man had nothing in his hands.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0065.wav|5|Truly also noted at this time that Oswald's hands were empty.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0075.wav|5|A test was also conducted to determine the time required to walk from the southeast corner of the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom by stairway.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0085.wav|5|from the southeast corner of the sixth floor down the stairway to the lunchroom.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0095.wav|5|That Oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the second-floor lunchroom
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0105.wav|5|They took the east elevator to the seventh floor and ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several minutes.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0115.wav|5|Oswald's use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other employees in the building.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0125.wav|5|Victoria Adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the Depository Building,
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0135.wav|5|ran up and said that the President had been shot.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0145.wav|5|Within a minute after Baker and Truly left Oswald in the lunchroom, Mrs. R. A. Reid, clerical supervisor for the Texas School Book Depository,
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0155.wav|5|The only exit from the office in the direction Oswald was moving was through the door to the front stairway.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0165.wav|5|At that time the building had not yet been sealed off by the police.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0175.wav|5|The sergeant did the same thing at the rear of the building.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0185.wav|5|After inspecting this floor, Sawyer returned to the street about 3 minutes after he entered the building.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0195.wav|5|Satisfying himself that Oswald was missing, Truly obtained Oswald's address, phone number, and description from his employment application card.
e_woman2/train/LJ035-0205.wav|5|and no one could be found who saw Oswald anywhere else in the building until after the shooting.
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0005.wav|5|He arrived at approximately 1 p.m. and left a few minutes later.
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0015.wav|5|According to the reconstruction of time and events which the Commission found most credible,
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0025.wav|5|McWatters was sure that he left the checkpoint on time
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0035.wav|5|The man was on the bus approximately 4 minutes.
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0045.wav|5|Mrs. Bledsoe told him, quote, I am not going to rent to you any more, end quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0055.wav|5|Mrs. Bledsoe identified the shirt as the one Oswald was wearing and she stated she was certain that it was Oswald who boarded the bus.
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0065.wav|5|Oswald lived at 1026 North Beckley.
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0075.wav|5|walked seven blocks directly to Murphy and Elm, and boarded a bus almost immediately,
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0085.wav|5|Oswald rose from his chair, looked directly at Fritz, and said, quote, Everybody will know who I am now, end quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0095.wav|5|but the Commission concluded that this man was not Lee Harvey Oswald,
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0105.wav|5|He said, quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0115.wav|5|David Knapp, aged 18, was No. 2;
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0125.wav|5|and that sometimes he made his entry right after a trip while at other times he waited to record three or four trips.
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0135.wav|5|I started to that address, and the police cars, the sirens was going, running crisscrossing everywhere, just a big uproar in that end of town and I said,
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0145.wav|5|However, Neches and Beckley do not intersect.
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0155.wav|5|Whaley testified that Oswald was wearing either the gray zippered jacket or the heavy blue jacket.

e_woman2/train/LJ036-0185.wav|5|He hurried to his room and stayed no longer than 3 or 4 minutes.
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0195.wav|5|He was described by Chief Curry as having the reputation of being "a very fine, dedicated officer."
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0205.wav|5|Tippit must have heard the description of the suspect wanted for the President's shooting; it was broadcast over channel 1 at 12:45 p.m.,
e_woman2/train/LJ036-0215.wav|5|He approached the car and apparently exchanged words with Tippit through the right front or vent window.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0007.wav|5|Three others subsequently identified Oswald from a photograph.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0017.wav|5|The man cut across the yard through some bushes, passed within 12 feet of Scoggins, and ran south on Patton.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0027.wav|5|Benavides stopped and waited in the truck until the gunman ran to the corner.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0037.wav|5|As she waited on the northwest corner of the intersection for traffic to pass, she noticed a young man as he was, quote, almost ready to get up on the curb, end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0047.wav|5|Mrs. Markham then ran to Officer Tippit's side and saw him lying in a pool of blood.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0057.wav|5|He said that Mrs. Markham started crying when Oswald walked into the lineup room.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0067.wav|5|the transcript establishes that she was referring to the uncombed state of his hair, a description fully supported by a photograph of Oswald
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0077.wav|5|Barbara Jeanette Davis and Virginia Davis, were in an apartment of a multiple-unit house on the southeast corner of 10th and Patton
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0087.wav|5|I was pretty sure it was the same man I saw. When they made him turn sideways, I was positive that was the one I seen, end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0097.wav|5|Smith subsequently told a Commission staff member
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0107.wav|5|They saw a man coming south on Patton with a revolver held high in his right hand. According to Callaway, the man crossed to the west side of Patton.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0117.wav|5|Both men picked Oswald as the man who had run south on Patton with a gun in his hand.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0127.wav|5|Four men -- Warren Reynolds, Harold Russell, Pat Patterson, and L. J. Lewis
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0137.wav|5|He was then shown two photographs of Oswald and he advised that Oswald was, quote, unquestionably, end quote, the man he saw.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0147.wav|5|It was the unanimous and unequivocal testimony of expert witnesses before the Commission that these used cartridge cases were fired from the revolver

e_woman2/train/LJ037-0207.wav|5|Michaelis furnished the shipping copy of the invoice, and the Railway Express Agency shipping documents, showing that
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0217.wav|5|Police found an empty revolver holster when they searched Oswald's room on Beckley Avenue after his arrest.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0227.wav|5|Mrs. Markham told Poe
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0237.wav|5|When interviewed by FBI agents on January 21, 1964,
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0247.wav|5|Marina Oswald also identified Commission Exhibit No. 162, the jacket found by Captain Westbrook, as her husband's second jacket.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0257.wav|5|Scoggins thought it was lighter.
e_woman2/train/LJ037-0267.wav|5|to the exclusion of all other weapons,
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0008.wav|5|Brewer knew from radio broadcasts that the President had been shot and that a patrolman had also been shot in Oak Cliff.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0018.wav|5|Shortly thereafter, Johnny Brewer, who had come from the nearby shoestore, asked Mrs. Postal whether the fellow that had ducked in had bought a ticket.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0028.wav|5|Brewer met McDonald and the other policemen at the alley exit door,
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0038.wav|5|McDonald struck back with his right hand and grabbed the gun with his left hand. They both fell into the seats.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0048.wav|5|Testimony of a firearms expert before the Commission established that the hammer of the revolver never touched the shell in the chamber.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0058.wav|5|Officer Ray Hawkins said
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0068.wav|5|cursing a little bit and hollering police brutality, end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0078.wav|5|Oswald was questioned intermittently for approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m., on November 22, and 11 a.m.,
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0088.wav|5|The results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0098.wav|5|Denial of Rifle Ownership
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0108.wav|5|that they had superimposed upon the photographs a rifle and a revolver. He told Fritz a number of times that the smaller photograph
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0118.wav|5|The Aliases "Hidell" and "O. H. Lee"
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0128.wav|5|He also denied that he had received the rifle through this box.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0138.wav|5|When asked about the curtain rod story, Oswald lied again.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0148.wav|5|Actions During and After Shooting
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0158.wav|5|Jarman testified that he ate his lunch on the first floor around 5 minutes to 12, and that he neither ate lunch with nor saw Oswald.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0168.wav|5|There were no eyewitnesses, although a 14-year-old boy in a neighboring house claimed that immediately after the shooting

e_woman2/train/LJ038-0188.wav|5|2. Send the information as to what has happened to me to the Embassy.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0200.wav|5|the city jail is located at the end of the bridge through which we always passed on going to the city (right in the beginning of the city after crossing the bridge).
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0210.wav|5|according to Marina Oswald when he learned on the radio and in the newspapers the next day that he had missed,
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0220.wav|5|Oswald had paid the first month's rent in advance on March 2, 1963,
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0230.wav|5|The county jail is at the corner of Houston and Main Streets, quote, right in the beginning of the city, end quote, after one travels through the underpass.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0240.wav|5|The third photograph identified by Marina Oswald depicts the entrance to General Walker's driveway from a back alley.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0250.wav|5|Another photograph of railroad tracks found among Oswald's possessions was not identified by his wife,
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0260.wav|5|On November 30, 1963, the FBI requested the bullet for ballistics examination;
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0270.wav|5|which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from the Mannlicher-Carcano rifle owned by Lee Harvey Oswald.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0280.wav|5|And for purposes of probative value, for whatever it might be worth,
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0290.wav|5|provide important corroboration for her account of the incident.
e_woman2/train/LJ038-0300.wav|5|Based on (1) the contents of the note which Oswald left for his wife on April 10, 1963,
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0004.wav|5|Chapter 4. The Assassin: Part 8.
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0014.wav|5|Marina Oswald appeared before the Commission again on June 11, 1964,
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0024.wav|5|She stated that it was not physical force which kept him from leaving the house. Quote, I couldn't keep him from going out if he really wanted to, end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0034.wav|5|The Commission has concluded, therefore, that regardless of what Oswald may have said to his wife
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0044.wav|5|Mr. Johnson was the then Vice President and his visit took place on April 23rd.
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0054.wav|5|Oswald's Rifle Capability

e_woman2/train/LJ039-0114.wav|5|When asked to explain the different scores achieved by Oswald on the two occasions when he fired for record,
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0124.wav|5|End quote. Major Anderson concluded, quote, I would say that as compared to other Marines receiving the same type of training,
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0134.wav|5|During one of his leaves from the Marines, Oswald hunted with his brother Robert,

e_woman2/train/LJ039-0164.wav|5|from a tower at three silhouette targets at distances of 175, 240, and 265 feet.
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0174.wav|5|The marksmen took as much time as they wanted for the first target and all hit the target.
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0184.wav|5|Considering the various probabilities which may have prevailed during the actual assassination,
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0194.wav|5|All three of the firers in these tests
e_woman2/train/LJ039-0204.wav|5|Frazier later fired four groups of three shots at a distance of 100 yards in 5.9, 6.2,

e_woman2/train/LJ039-0234.wav|5|the Commission concluded that Oswald was capable of accomplishing this second hit even if there was an intervening shot which missed.

e_woman2/train/LJ040-0006.wav|5|The Commission has considered many possible motives for the assassination, including those which might flow from Oswald's commitment to Marxism or communism,
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0016.wav|5|and in the history of his life which does give some insight into his character and, possibly, into the motives for his act.
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0026.wav|5|He had very few, if any, close relationships with other people and he appeared to have great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world.
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0036.wav|5|and, apparently seriously, as a political prophet -- a man who said that after 20 years he would be prime minister.

e_woman2/train/LJ040-0076.wav|5|In the fall of that year John Pic and Robert Oswald went to a military academy
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0086.wav|5|In the fall of 1948 she told John Pic and Robert Oswald
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0096.wav|5|Pic said, quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0106.wav|5|It also appears that Lee tried to tag along with his older brothers
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0116.wav|5|who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother, having struck her on at least one occasion.
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0126.wav|5|Oswald was remanded for psychiatric observation to Youth House, an institution in which children are kept for psychiatric observation
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0136.wav|5|There are children in here who have killed people, and smoke. I want to get out, end quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0146.wav|5|He noted that Lee liked to give the impression that he did not care for other people but preferred to keep to himself,
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0156.wav|5|No finding of neurological impairment or psychotic mental changes could be made.
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0166.wav|5|She also noted that there was, quote, a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved, affectionless youngster
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0176.wav|5|He admitted to fantasies about being powerful and sometimes hurting and killing people, but refused to elaborate on them.
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0186.wav|5|Lee scored an IQ of 118 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0196.wav|5|into which he appeared to be retreating.
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0206.wav|5|that Lee's withdrawal was a form of, quote, violent but silent protest against his neglect by her
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0216.wav|5|In view of his experiences when he visited his relatives in New Orleans in the spring of 1950, and his other solitary habits,
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0226.wav|5|I couldn't in all honesty sincerely say such a thing.
e_woman2/train/LJ040-0236.wav|5|and when his mother failed to cooperate in any way with school authorities,
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0006.wav|5|His mother exercised little control over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go on in school.
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0016.wav|5|Voebel took Oswald back to the school to attend to his wounds, and their, quote, mild friendship, end quote, stemmed from that incident.
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0026.wav|5|from which Oswald appeared to suffer.
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0036.wav|5|He was a little dismayed at this, and he said that he couldn't find any that would show any interest in him as a Communist,
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0046.wav|5|There is evidence that Oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join the Marines by the fact that his brother Robert had done so
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0056.wav|5|in his intense desire to join the Marines and get away from his surroundings and his mother.
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0066.wav|5|his general personality would alienate the group against him, end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0076.wav|5|and put them in positions of prominence, end quote. Oswald manifested this feeling about authority by baiting his officers.
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0086.wav|5|and then used the, quote, special treatment, end quote, he received as an example of the way in which he was being picked on and, quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0096.wav|5|Normally, it would be a good type of literature; and the one that I recall was "Leaves of Grass," by Walt Whitman, end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0106.wav|5|At the court-martial hearing which followed, Oswald admitted that he had been rather drunk when the incident occurred.
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0116.wav|5|after it was learned that he had defected to the Soviet Union.
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0126.wav|5|But while we were in Russia he spoke well of him. Lee said that when he would return to the United States he would vote for him for Governor, end quote.

e_woman2/train/LJ041-0146.wav|5|it was more in terms of a general hostility against the government and its representatives rather than a grudge against any particular person.

e_woman2/train/LJ041-0166.wav|5|in honor of some retiring noncommissioned officers, an event which they both approached with little enthusiasm.
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0176.wav|5|He recalled that Oswald had a specific interest in Latin America, particularly Cuba,
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0186.wav|5|as some kind of tribunal,
e_woman2/train/LJ041-0196.wav|5|even though as his wife suggested, that interest may have been motivated by a desire to gain attention. He used his Marxist and associated activities

e_woman2/train/LJ042-0023.wav|5|and that he went there, quote, only to find freedom. I could never have been personally happy in the U.S., end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ042-0033.wav|5|of his concomitant hatred of the United States, which was most clearly expressed in his November 26,

e_woman2/train/LJ043-0014.wav|5|Oswald was, quote, very, very disagreeable and disappointed, end quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ043-0024.wav|5|Even though it appears that they may have left Oswald a few days before, it seems that he resisted the move as best he could.
e_woman2/train/LJ043-0034.wav|5|Contacts with De Mohrenschildt and his wife did continue and they saw the Oswalds occasionally until the spring of 1963.
e_woman2/train/LJ043-0044.wav|5|The latter testified that they, quote, were just together again, end quote, as if his brother, quote, had not been to Russia, end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ043-0054.wav|5|Oswald moved to Dallas on about October 8, 1962, without telling his mother where he was going.

e_woman2/train/LJ043-0114.wav|5|Oswald told his wife and Mrs. Paine that he was working as a commercial photographer.
e_woman2/train/LJ043-0124.wav|5|Ironically, he failed to get a job in another photographic firm after his return to Dallas in October of 1963,

e_woman2/train/LJ044-0026.wav|5|Marina Oswald said she signed that name, apparently chosen because it rhymed with "Fidel,"

e_woman2/train/LJ044-0047.wav|5|that anyone ever attacked any street demonstration in which Oswald was involved, except for the Bringuier incident mentioned above,

e_woman2/train/LJ044-0077.wav|5|This would have made him a real center of attention as he must have been when he first arrived in the Soviet Union
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0087.wav|5|Oswald was confronted with those facts at the beginning of the debate and was so thrown on the defensive by this that he was forced to state that
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0097.wav|5|Stuckey thought Oswald, quote, appeared to be a very logical, intelligent fellow, end quote, and, quote, was arrested by his cleancutness, end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0107.wav|5|and advised them of some of his activities on behalf of the organization.
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0117.wav|5|that there were people who understood his activity, end quote.
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0127.wav|5|In reply Arnold Johnson advised Oswald that, while as an American citizen he had a right to participate in such organizations as he wished, quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0137.wav|5|More seriously, the facts of his defection had become known, leaving him open to almost unanswerable attack by those who opposed his views.
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0147.wav|5|and in late June or early July he told his wife that he wanted to return to the Soviet Union with her. She said that he was extremely upset,
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0157.wav|5|he requested the Embassy to rush his wife's entrance visa because of the impending birth of the second child but stated that, quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0167.wav|5|He asked his wife to help him to hijack an airplane to get there, but gave up that scheme when she refused.

e_woman2/train/LJ044-0197.wav|5|It should be noted that his interest in Cuba seems to have increased along with the sense of frustration which must have developed
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0207.wav|5|the economic embargo against that country, and the general policy of the United States with regard to Cuba.
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0218.wav|5|In this connection it should be noted that in speaking of the Worker, Oswald told Michael Paine, apparently in all seriousness, that, quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0228.wav|5|it should be remembered that his wife testified that he was disappointed with his failure to get to Cuba
e_woman2/train/LJ044-0238.wav|5|The fact that Oswald left behind the funds which might have enabled him to reach Cuba suggests the absence of any plan to try to flee there

e_woman2/train/LJ045-0029.wav|5|The sole exception was the weekend of November 16 to 17, 1963, the weekend before the assassination,

e_woman2/train/LJ045-0049.wav|5|Lee would say that it would be better for me if I went to Russia. I did not know why. I did not know what he had in mind.
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0059.wav|5|The instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people. Oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife.

e_woman2/train/LJ045-0079.wav|5|As a result Oswald struck her, as to which she testified, quote,

e_woman2/train/LJ045-0149.wav|5|She said, quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0159.wav|5|Question: How did you indicate to him that you were angry with him? Answer: By not talking to him.
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0169.wav|5|That this was better because while he was living alone and I stayed with Ruth, we were spending less money. And I told him to buy me a washing machine, because two children
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0179.wav|5|He took with him $13.87 and the long brown package that Frazier and Mrs. Randle saw him carry
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0189.wav|5|it should be noted that mention of the Trade Mart as the expected site of the Presidential luncheon
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0199.wav|5|Whether he thought about assassinating the President over the weekend can never be known, but it is reasonably certain
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0209.wav|5|but it was also, at least in part, because his wife did not want to live there with him.
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0219.wav|5|that he wanted to make peace with her and bring his family to Dallas where they could live with him again.
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0229.wav|5|He then killed Patrolman Tippit when that police officer apparently tried to question him after he had left his roominghouse and he vigorously resisted arrest
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0239.wav|5|which has been set forth above, only served to prolong the period during which he was the center of the attention of the entire world.
e_woman2/train/LJ045-0249.wav|5|Out of these and the many other factors which may have molded the character of Lee Harvey Oswald
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0009.wav|5|when visiting Miami on February 15, 1933; and on President Harry S. Truman on November 1, 1950,
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0019.wav|5|In this part of its inquiry the Commission has had full access to a major study of all phases of protective activities
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0029.wav|5|It is unlikely that measures can be devised to eliminate entirely the multitude of diverse dangers that may arise,
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0039.wav|5|As the ceremonial head of the Government the President must discharge a wide range of public duties, not only in Washington but throughout the land.
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0049.wav|5|More often than not, Presidential journeys have served more than one purpose at the same time: ceremonial,
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0059.wav|5|Since 1945, Roosevelt's successors have ranged the world,

e_woman2/train/LJ046-0139.wav|5|to refer all communications on identified existing cases and, in addition,
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0149.wav|5|There are many actions, situations, and incidents that may indicate such potential danger. Some are specific, such as threats;
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0159.wav|5|accumulated over a 20-year period, some of which included more than one individual.
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0169.wav|5|If the field office determines that the case should be subject to continuing review, PRS establishes a file
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0179.wav|5|being reviewed regularly.
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0189.wav|5|PRS had received, over a 20-year period, basic information on some 50,000 cases;
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0199.wav|5|The general files of PRS were not indexed by geographic location and were of little use in preparing for a Presidential visit to a specific locality.
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0209.wav|5|In the absence of more specific instructions, other Federal agencies interpreted the Secret Service's informal requests
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0219.wav|5|The above action should be taken without delay in order to attempt to verify the information and no evaluation of the information should be attempted.
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0229.wav|5|The Commission believes that the facilities and procedures of the Protective Research Section of the Secret Service
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0239.wav|5|notwithstanding the fact that Ambassador Stevenson had been abused by pickets in Dallas less than a month before.
e_woman2/train/LJ046-0249.wav|5|about persons other than those who were obvious threats to the President.
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0005.wav|5|Oswald was known to other Federal agencies with which the Secret Service maintained intelligence liaison.
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0015.wav|5|From defection to return to Fort Worth.
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0025.wav|5|During the next 2 years the FBI continued to accumulate information,
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0035.wav|5|Oswald's file at the Department of State Passport Office was reviewed in June 1962.
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0045.wav|5|and promised to advise the FBI if he heard from them.
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0055.wav|5|It does not preclude the agent in charge of the case from reopening it if he feels that further work should be done.
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0065.wav|5|This information led Hosty to review Oswald's file, from which he learned that Oswald had become a subscriber to the Worker,
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0075.wav|5|Hosty had inquired earlier and found no evidence that it was functioning in the Dallas area.
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0085.wav|5|The FBI had not asked to be informed of any effort by Oswald to obtain a passport,
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0095.wav|5|On the next day, he asked the New Orleans police to arrange for him to be interviewed by the FBI.
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0105.wav|5|In Quigley's judgment,
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0115.wav|5|Several days later, the Bureau received additional evidence that Oswald had lied to Agent Quigley.
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0125.wav|5|In other words, he committed no violation of the law by telling us something that wasn't true, and unless this required further investigation at that time,
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0135.wav|5|According to the information received by the Bureau
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0145.wav|5|The CIA message was sent also to the Department of State where it was reviewed by personnel of the Passport Office, who knew from Oswald's file

e_woman2/train/LJ047-0165.wav|5|At the end of the interview, Marina Oswald came into the room. When he observed that she seemed, quote, quite alarmed, end quote, about the visit,

e_woman2/train/LJ047-0215.wav|5|including the significant fact that Oswald was employed in a building which overlooked the motorcade route.
e_woman2/train/LJ047-0225.wav|5|Hosty testified that he did not know until the evening of Thursday, November 21, that there was to be a motorcade, however,

e_woman2/train/LJ047-0245.wav|5|His secretary testified that she prepared such a report for him that afternoon and Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0005.wav|5|There was nothing up to the time of the assassination that gave any indication that this man was a dangerous character who might do harm to the President
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0015.wav|5|We talked to him twice.
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0025.wav|5|and had told Mrs. Paine that when he got the money he was going to take an apartment, when the baby was old enough, he was going to take an apartment, and the family would live together.

e_woman2/train/LJ048-0055.wav|5|a more alert and carefully considered treatment of the Oswald case by the Bureau might have brought about such a referral.

e_woman2/train/LJ048-0095.wav|5|The Service prefers to have two agents perform advance preparations.
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0105.wav|5|but these routes would not have been in accordance with the White House staff instructions given the Secret Service for a desirable motorcade route.
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0116.wav|5|Agent Lawson was not given written instructions concerning the Dallas trip or advice about any peculiar problems which it might involve;
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0126.wav|5|Special Agent in Charge Sorrels testified that the advance preparations followed on this occasion were, quote, pretty much the same, end quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0136.wav|5|In the description of the important aspects of the advance preparations,
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0146.wav|5|Discussions with the Dallas authorities and requests made of them were entirely informal.
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0156.wav|5|and suggested the desirability of such a statement.
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0166.wav|5|But on out-of-town trips where the route is decided on and made public only a few days in advance,
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0176.wav|5|Even if it were possible with a vastly larger force of security officers to do so, many observers have felt
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0186.wav|5|Instead of such advance precautions, the Secret Service depended in part on the efforts of local law enforcement personnel stationed along the route.
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0196.wav|5|According to Captain Lawrence, quote,
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0206.wav|5|As the motorcade approached Elm Street
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0216.wav|5|stated that he scanned the Depository Building, but not sufficiently to be alerted by anything in the windows or on the roof.
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0226.wav|5|All of the agents stayed for a drink of beer, or in several cases, a mixed drink.
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0236.wav|5|There is no indication that any of the agents who visited the Cellar Coffee House had any intoxicating drink at that establishment.

e_woman2/train/LJ048-0256.wav|5|as a result of the investigation he ordered, he was satisfied that each of the agents performed his duties in an entirely satisfactory manner
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0266.wav|5|and special agents cooperating with them on Presidential and similar protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for official duty
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0276.wav|5|Since he was convinced that this was not the case, he believed that it would be unfair to the agents and their families to take explicit disciplinary measures.
e_woman2/train/LJ048-0286.wav|5|Nor is this goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours, and lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep.
